## Getting Started

To run the blog locally, you'll need Node.js and pnpm installed on your system. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the project dependencies with `pnpm install`.
3. Start the development server with `pnpm dev.`
4. Open your browser and visit <http://localhost:4321> to see the blog in action.

## Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll find the following directories and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── ...
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── pages/
│       └── ...
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory. These files will be copied into the final build.
