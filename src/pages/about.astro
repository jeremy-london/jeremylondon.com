          My name is Jeremy London üëã, based in the vibrant city of Denver üèîÔ∏è, where I merge my deep-seated passion for AI and machine learning with practical experiences from <strong><a href="https://lockheedmartin.com">Lockheed Martin</a></strong> to innovative startups like <strong><a href="https://vody.com">Vody</a></strong>. Specializing in multimodal systems and Large Language Models, I thrive on pushing the boundaries of technology to explore new solutions.
