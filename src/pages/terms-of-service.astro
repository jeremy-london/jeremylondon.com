      <p>
        Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials
        (information or software) on our website for personal, non-commercial
        transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer
        of title, and under this license, you may not modify or copy the
        materials; use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any
        public display (commercial or non-commercial); attempt to decompile or
        reverse engineer any software contained on our website; remove any
        copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or transfer
        the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other
        server.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Disclaimer</h2>

        The materials on our website are provided on an 'as is' basis. We make
        no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaim and negate all
        other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or
        conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
        non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.
        Further, we do not warrant or make any representations concerning the
        accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        In no event shall we or our suppliers be liable for any damages
        (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or
        due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use
        the materials on our website, even if we or our authorized
        representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility
        of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on
        implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or
        incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
