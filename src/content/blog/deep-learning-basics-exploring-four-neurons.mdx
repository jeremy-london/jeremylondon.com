After dissecting the workings of a single neuron, it's time to scale up our exploration to a network layer composed of four neurons. This advancement allows us to delve into the dynamics of multiple neurons working together, a fundamental step towards understanding complex neural networks. 

## Expanding to Four Neurons

The leap from a single neuron to a layer of four neurons offers a window into the interplay of multiple processing units within a neural network. This section will navigate through the intricacies of managing a four-neuron layer, emphasizing the significance of matrix operations and ReLU activation in shaping neural network behavior.

### Walking Through the Code

In this segment, I'll guide you through a Python script designed to simulate a four-neuron network layer. This script will illustrate how inputs are processed collectively, highlighting the enhanced computational power and complexity.

1. **NumPy for Matrix Operations:**
   - Our journey continues with NumPy, a critical tool for handling matrix operations with ease. Matrix operations form the backbone of neural network computations, especially when dealing with multiple neurons.

2. **The Power of Matrix Multiplication:**
   - I'll demonstrate how to apply matrix multiplication to calculate the outputs of a four-neuron layer. This involves multiplying the input vector by the weight matrix for the layer and then adding the bias vector, encapsulating each neuron's weights and biases.

3. **Applying ReLU to the Layer:**
   - Following the linear calculations, we apply the ReLU activation function across the output vector of the layer. This step is pivotal in introducing non-linearity, enabling the network to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data.

4. **Visualizing the Interactions:**
   - By breaking down these operations, I aim to provide a clear visualization of how individual neurons within a layer interact and contribute to the network's overall function.

5. **Running the Simulation:**
   - With the setup ready, I run the simulation, showcasing the output of our four-neuron layer post-ReLU activation. This hands-on example solidifies the theoretical concepts discussed, offering practical insights into neural network operations.
