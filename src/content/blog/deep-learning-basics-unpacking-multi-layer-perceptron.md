As the sixth part of our Deep Learning Basics Series, this post delves into the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), a foundational architecture for deep neural networks. Exploring an MLP with seven layers, we'll cover the intricacies of forward propagation through multiple layers and the critical role of activation functions in enhancing the network's ability to model complex relationships.

## Series Overview

This series installment builds on the previous concepts introduced in the "Deep Learning Basics Series," aiming to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of neural network architectures. The MLP represents a significant step towards constructing deep and powerful neural networks capable of handling diverse and complex datasets.

## Deepening Your Network with MLP

1. **Understanding MLP Architecture:** Gain insights into why and how multiple layers are stacked to create a deep neural network.
2. **Forward Propagation Explained:** Learn the step-by-step process of moving input data through the layers of an MLP, applying the ReLU activation function to introduce non-linearity.
3. **Managing Network Parameters:** Discover strategies for counting and managing the parameters in an MLP, which are crucial for understanding the network's learning capabilities and computational requirements.

For a practical exploration, refer to the [multi_layer_perceptron_relu.py](./multi_layer_perceptron_relu.py) code. This hands-on example will help solidify your understanding of configuring and working with a multi-layer perceptron.
