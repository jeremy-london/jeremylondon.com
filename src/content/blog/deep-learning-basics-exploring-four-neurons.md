In the third part of our Deep Learning Basics Series, we build upon the single neuron concept to explore a layer composed of four neurons. This post delves into calculating the outputs of each neuron within a layer using matrix operations and the ReLU activation function, showcasing the essential role of non-linear activation in neural computations.

## Series Overview

This post is part of the "Deep Learning Basics Series," designed to introduce foundational concepts in neural network design and operation. Through this series, we aim to equip readers with a solid understanding of the building blocks of neural networks, leading to more advanced topics in later posts.

## Exploring a Four Neuron Layer

- **Matrix Operations:** Gain insights into multiplying the input vector with each neuron's weights and adding a bias term to calculate the layer's output.
- **ReLU Activation Across Neurons:** Understand how the ReLU function is applied to each neuron's output, facilitating non-linearity across the network.
- **Parameter Counting:** Learn to count the parameters of each node and the entire network, providing a glimpse into the network's complexity.

The [four_neurons_relu.py](./four_neurons_relu.py) code example offers a hands-on experience in configuring and understanding a four-neuron layer, further solidifying the concepts discussed.
