Welcome to Part 1 of our Deep Learning Foundations series. In this opening post, we dive into matrix multiplication, the bedrock upon which neural network operations are built. Understanding this key concept of linear algebra is essential for anyone venturing into the field of deep learning.

## Matrix Multiplication: The First Step

- **Dimensions and Scaling:** Grasp how the dimensions of matrices influence each other and the impact of scaling.
- **Dot Product Basics:** Uncover the mechanics of dot products in combining matrix rows and columns, crucial for neural network architectures.
