In the seventh installment of our Deep Learning Basics Series, we unravel the complexities of backpropagation, the cornerstone algorithm that allows neural networks to adjust and learn from every iteration. This post provides a thorough understanding of the backpropagation process, highlighting its critical role in the neural network training process by adjusting weights and biases to minimize loss.

## Navigating Through Backpropagation

1. **Backpropagation Basics:** Uncover the principles behind backpropagation, including how gradients are calculated and used to update network parameters.
2. **Step-by-Step Calculation:** Walk through the backpropagation process in a multi-layer perceptron, illustrating how to compute gradients for weights and biases at each layer.
3. **Optimizing the Network:** Learn about the significance of gradient descent in the backpropagation algorithm, and how it's applied to refine the network's performance.

Dive into the [backpropagation.py](./backpropagation.py) code for an in-depth look at how backpropagation is implemented and functions within a neural network, marking a fitting end to our deep learning basics exploration.
