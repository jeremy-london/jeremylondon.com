In Part 2 of our Deep Learning Foundations series, we explore the single neuron - the basic building block of neural networks. Understanding how a single neuron processes inputs and generates an output is crucial for grasping more complex network structures.

## Single Neuron: The Core Unit

- **Neuron Output Calculation:** Learn the process of calculating a neuron's output using an input vector and weights, highlighting the role of the ReLU function.

Dive into [single_neuron_relu.py](./single_neuron_relu.py) as we continue our deep dive into the neural network basics.
