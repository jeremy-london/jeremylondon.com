The fourth installment of our Deep Learning Basics Series introduces the concept of hidden layers, a pivotal element that adds depth and complexity to neural networks. This post walks readers through the process of incorporating a hidden layer into a network, elucidating the computations involved and the significant role hidden layers play in augmenting the network's learning capabilities.

## Series Overview

As part of the "Deep Learning Basics Series," this post aims to explore foundational aspects of neural network architecture. We progressively build upon earlier concepts to deepen readers' understanding of how neural networks can be structured for more effective learning and prediction.

## Discovering Hidden Layers

1. **Introduction to Hidden Layers:** Uncover the basics of hidden layers and their transformative impact on neural network architecture.
2. **Computational Walkthrough:** A detailed guide through the computations from the input layer to the hidden layer and finally to the output, emphasizing the ReLU activation function's role.
3. **Weights and Nodes Correlation:** Delve into the dynamics between weights and nodes across different layers, enhancing your grasp of sophisticated network designs.

Check out the [hidden_layer_relu.py](./hidden_layer_relu.py) code to witness the implementation and operational dynamics of a hidden layer within a neural network.
