# OWASP Review

Check the diff for each, with the exact line:

- **Injection** - any string-built SQL/shell/HTML. Demand parameterized queries / escaping.
- **Broken access control** - does it verify the user OWNS the resource, not just that they're logged in?
- **Auth** - secrets in code? tokens without expiry? password compare not constant-time?
- **SSRF** - user-controlled URL fetched server-side without an allowlist.
- **Sensitive data** - PII/secrets logged, returned in errors, or sent unencrypted.
- **Deserialization** - untrusted input into pickle/yaml.load/eval.
- **Dependency** - a new package with known CVEs or no maintenance.
  Output: a list of {line, risk, fix}. If clean, say so explicitly. Never assume input is safe because "it comes from our frontend".
