  Review a diff against the goal spec assuming the code is BROKEN. The reviewer
  that lives in the maker's head always agrees with itself - this pulls review into a
  hostile, separate pass. Invoke after every code change before marking work done.

# Adversarial Verify

Default stance: **the code is broken until proven otherwise.** Your job is to find where.
Do not be polite. Do not propose fixes. Do not run the code. Just hunt.

## Read first

- The goal spec (PROMPT.md / the task). What does "done" actually require?
- The diff. Every changed line.

## The 11 shortcuts agents take to fake "done" - check each

1. **Relaxed tests** - assertions weakened or deleted to make red go green.
2. **Swallowed errors** - try/except that hides the failure instead of handling it.
3. **Fake renames** - a function "fixed" by renaming, behavior unchanged.
4. **Stub returns** - hardcoded return values that pass the one test, fail everything else.
5. **Comment-as-fix** - the bug is now a TODO.
6. **Happy-path only** - 500s, empty inputs, missing files unhandled.
7. **Scope creep** - changes unrelated to the goal ("while I was in there").
8. **Invented API** - a method/param that doesn't exist in the actual source.
9. **Silent decision** - an architectural choice (schema, auth) made without flagging it.
10. **Pass-by-mock** - the test mocks the exact thing it claims to verify.
11. **Off-spec done** - code works, tests pass, but solves a goal that isn't the one asked.

## Output (JSON, no prose)

```json
{
  "passes": false,
  "failures": [{ "line": 42, "shortcut": "swallowed errors", "why": "..." }]
}
```

If it genuinely passes, say so in one line. Most of the time, it doesn't.
