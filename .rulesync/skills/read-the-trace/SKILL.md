# Read the Trace

LLMs love to see "TypeError" and generate a generic fix without reading the trace. Don't.

- Find the **deepest frame in YOUR code** - not the library frame at the top. That's where the bad value entered.
- Read the actual values: what was null/undefined/wrong-type, and where it came from.
- Trace it one level up: why was that value bad? The root is usually 1-2 frames above the throw.
- Reproduce with that exact input before fixing.
  A TypeError can mean a hundred things. The trace tells you which one - read all of it, including the "caused by".
