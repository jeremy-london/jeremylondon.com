# Reduce Nesting

Deep nesting hides bugs in the branches you didn't read.

- **Guard clauses** - handle the invalid/edge cases first and return early. The happy path drops to the left margin.
- **Invert conditions** - `if (!valid) return;` instead of wrapping the whole body in `if (valid) {...}`.
- **Extract** - a nested block doing one thing becomes a named function.
- **Replace flag-then-branch** - return the result directly instead of setting a variable to return later.
  Target: no function deeper than 2-3 levels. If you still need more, the function is doing too much - split it.
