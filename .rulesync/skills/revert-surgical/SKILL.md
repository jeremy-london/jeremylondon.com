# Surgical Revert

Don't `git reset --hard` away three good commits to undo one bad one.

- **Single commit** - `git revert <sha>` creates an inverse commit; history stays intact and shared-branch-safe.
- **One file from a commit** - `git checkout <good-sha> -- path/to/file`.
- **Hunk-level** - `git checkout -p` to revert specific changes, keep the rest.
- **A merge** - `git revert -m 1 <merge-sha>` (pick the mainline parent).
  On a shared branch, always revert (forward), never rewrite history. Reproduce the breakage first so you revert the RIGHT thing, then verify the revert actually fixes it.
