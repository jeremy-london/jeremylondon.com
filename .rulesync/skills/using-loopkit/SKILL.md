# Using Loopkit

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a loopkit skill applies to what you are doing, INVOKE it.

IF A SKILL APPLIES, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This overrides "just answer quickly" instincts. Not negotiable.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## The Rule

**Invoke relevant skills BEFORE any response or action** - including clarifying questions, exploring the codebase, or reading files. If it turns out wrong for the situation, drop it.

Then announce "Using [skill] to [purpose]" and follow the skill exactly. If it has a checklist, create a todo per item.

## Where the skills live

Skills are authored at `.rulesync/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and generated to each agent's skill directory. Each has YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, and `targets`. Load a skill by reading its source `SKILL.md` when its trigger matches your task.

## Skill routing (49 skills, 10 tracks)

| Task shape                                           | First skill                                                                          |

## Red Flags - STOP and check for a skill

| Thought                                   | Reality                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "This is just a simple question"          | Questions are tasks. Check first.                                                          |
| "Let me explore the codebase first"       | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first.                                               |
| "I remember this skill"                   | Skills evolve. Read the current SKILL.md.                                                  |
| "The skill is overkill"                   | Simple things become complex. Use it.                                                      |
| "I'll just do this one thing first"       | Check BEFORE doing anything.                                                               |
| "Tests pass, we're good"                  | `verification-before-completion` says: run the exact command, read the output, then claim. |
| "I'll do both features while I'm in here" | `single-feature-discipline` says: one per session. Never two.                              |
| "The reviewer will let this slide"        | `self-eval-bias` says: assume it will confidently praise. Calibrate first.                 |

## Priority when multiple skills apply

Process skills first (spec-first, systematic-debugging, planner-spec-expand, sprint-contract), then implementation skills (design-system, sql-review, etc.), then finishers (adversarial-verify, verification-before-completion, self-eval-bias, clean-commits).

- "Let's build X" → `planner-spec-expand` → `feature-list-json` → `sprint-contract` → domain skills → `adversarial-verify`.
- "Fix bug Y" → `systematic-debugging` → `read-the-trace` → fix → `verification-before-completion`.
- "Session open in existing project" → `progress-reading-protocol` → `sprint-contract` → work.

## User instructions win

Generated root rules, AGENTS.md, and direct user requests override loopkit skills. Only skip a skill workflow when the user has explicitly said to.
