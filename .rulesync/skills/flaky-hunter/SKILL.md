# Flaky Test Hunter

Run the suspect test 20x in a loop first - confirm it's actually flaky, not just broken.
Common causes, in order of likelihood:

1. **Time/order** - depends on test execution order or shared mutable state. Isolate it; run alone.
2. **Async race** - asserting before a promise/refetch resolves. Await the actual condition, not a sleep.
3. **Real network/clock/random** - mock them. Freeze time, seed RNG, stub the call.
4. **Resource leak** - a prior test left a connection/file/port open.
   Fix the cause, not the symptom. `retry(3)` on a flaky test hides a real race that will bite in production. Quarantine only as a last resort, with a ticket.
