# Coverage Gaps

Coverage % is a vanity metric. Hunt the gaps that bite:

- **Error paths** - the 500, the timeout, the empty/null input, the malformed payload. Almost always untested.
- **Boundaries** - 0, 1, max, off-by-one, empty collection.
- **Branches** - every `if/else` and `catch` exercised, not just the happy line.
- **Concurrency / order** - anything stateful tested in isolation AND in sequence.
  Skip tests that assert a constructor sets a property - worthless. Test behavior, not implementation. Output: the 3-5 highest-risk untested paths, ranked by blast radius, with the test to add.
