# Progress-Reading Protocol

You have no memory of the previous session. The repo does. Every fresh session burns 5-10 minutes reconstructing state unless you follow a fixed opening sequence - with the sequence, it drops to 30-60 seconds. The cost is 2-4k tokens at the top of every session; the payoff crosses over past four sessions on the same project.

Skipping steps is the failure mode. Sessions that skip the smoke-test step (6) reliably build new features on top of silently broken ones. See the "looks shipped, isn't shipped" bug (originally documented in the shift-work harness pattern).

## When to apply

- First tool calls of any coding-agent session in a multi-session project.
- After a context reset, compaction, or crash mid-project - treat the resumed context as a fresh session.
- Before you write a single line of new code. No exceptions for "quick fixes."

## Procedure - run in order, no skipping

1. **`pwd`** - confirm you are in the project directory. You may only edit files below this path.
2. **Read `session-progress.txt`** (or whatever the project's shift-notes file is called). This is the previous session's prose handoff.
3. **`git log --oneline -20`** - see what was actually committed. If the progress file and the git log disagree, trust the git log. The progress file can be truncated by a crashed write; the log is append-only.
4. **Count remaining features** - `cat feature_list.json | jq '[.[] | select(.passes==false)] | length'`. Adjust the field name to the project's schema. This anchors you to the source of truth for completion state.
5. **`./init.sh`** - bring up the dev server. If this fails, fixing it is your only job this session. Do not skip to feature work with a broken environment.
6. **Smoke-test the most recently "completed" feature** - drive it end-to-end via the browser-automation tool, `curl`, or the actual CLI. Not unit tests. If it fails, invoke [[broken-window-check]]: revert the offending commit, flip the feature back to `passes: false`, and fix it before touching new work.

Only after all six steps pass do you pick new work (see [[shift-notes]] for selection heuristics).

## Anti-patterns

- **"I already know this repo, I'll skip the read."** You do not. The context you have is the context in front of you.
- **Reading the progress file but not the git log.** The prose lies; the log does not.
- **Running `init.sh` and assuming success without smoke-testing a feature.** The dev server can start clean while every route is broken.
- **Smoke-testing with unit tests.** Unit tests can pass while the feature is end-to-end broken - wrong route, missing header, config mismatch. Drive the runtime path.
- **Batching the 6 steps into "let me just get oriented."** The steps are cheap because they are fixed. Improvising the orientation is where tokens leak.

## Cost/benefit

Roughly 2-4k tokens and 30-60 seconds of wall-clock at the top of every session. Payoff crosses over past ~4 sessions on the same project; below that, the ritual is overhead. If your project is one-shot, use [[verification-before-completion]] instead.

When NOT to apply: single-shot sessions with no prior state, or the very first session of a project (there is nothing to read yet - run the initializer instead).
