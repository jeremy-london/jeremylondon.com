# README Audit

A README's only job: a stranger clones it and gets to "it works" without asking you.
Check, in order:

1. **One sentence** on what it is and who it's for - above the fold.
2. **Install** - copy-paste commands that actually work on a clean machine. Test them mentally step by step.
3. **Run / quickstart** - the smallest end-to-end example.
4. **Config** - required env vars, where secrets go.
5. **No rot** - does it reference files/commands/flags that still exist? Stale README is worse than none.
   Cut: long philosophy, badges nobody reads, TODO sections. Output: the specific gaps + the fix.
