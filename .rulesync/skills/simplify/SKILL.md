# Simplify

Over-engineering is the default failure mode. Cut it:

- **Premature abstraction** - a class/strategy/factory for one caller. Inline it. Abstract on the THIRD use, not the first.
- **Speculative config** - a parameter/flag/env var for something that never changes. Hardcode it until there's a real reason.
- **Dead flexibility** - an interface with one implementation, a generic with one type. Delete the indirection.
- **Defensive noise** - null checks on values that can't be null, try/except for errors that can't happen. Handle only real failure modes.
  Test: can you justify every changed line by a direct connection to what was asked? If a line is there "while I was in there", revert it.
