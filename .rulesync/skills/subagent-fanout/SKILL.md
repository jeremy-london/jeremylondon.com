# Subagent Fan-out

One context loaded with ten jobs' worth of material is the exact shape that triggers context rot. Ten small contexts don't.

- Spawn one subagent per independent unit (one file, one source, one check). Each gets a fresh context window.
- An **orchestrator** synthesizes their results - it never does the per-unit work itself.
- Give each worker a tight role and only the input it needs.
- Use ONLY when the pieces are genuinely independent. Sequential dependencies stay in one chain.
  Fan-out for breadth (research, multi-file edits, multi-source verification). Keep it serial when step N needs step N-1's output.
