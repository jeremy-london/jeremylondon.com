# Kill Dead Code

1. **Prove it's dead** - no references (grep the symbol across the repo, including dynamic/string usage and tests). Unused export ≠ dead if it's a public API.
2. Check it's not feature-flagged off (dead today, alive when the flag flips).
3. Delete it AND its now-orphaned tests, imports, and config.
4. Run the full suite + a build. Dead code removal should change behavior in exactly zero ways.
   Bias to delete: every line someone has to read is a cost. But never delete what you can't prove is unreachable - say "I think X is unused, confirm?" instead of guessing.
