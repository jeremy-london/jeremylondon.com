# Context Budget

More context is not better. Past a threshold, accuracy falls off a cliff (context rot).

- **Don't dump whole files** - read the relevant function/section, not the 2000-line module.
- **Summarize, don't accumulate** - replace a 200K-token transcript with a 4K recap of the load-bearing facts.
- **Drop dead context** - once a sub-task is done, its detail leaves the window. Keep the decision, drop the trace.
- **State on disk, not in context** - progress goes to a file the next turn re-reads, not into an ever-growing prompt.
  A bloated standing context file taxes every single turn. Trim weekly. If the agent is confidently wrong, suspect the context before the model.
