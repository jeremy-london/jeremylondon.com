# Contract Test

Test what the two sides AGREED on, so either can change internals without breaking the other.

- Assert the **shape**: required fields, types, status codes, error format - not internal logic.
- Cover the contract's edges: missing optional fields, the documented error responses, pagination bounds, versioning.
- For consumers: test against the real contract (recorded/real responses), not a mock you wrote to match your assumptions - that mock drifts and lies.
- One source of truth for the schema; both sides validate against it.
  A green unit test with a wrong mock is worse than no test. Pin the contract.
