# Verification Before Completion

Claiming work done without fresh verification is dishonesty, not efficiency. `adversarial-verify` is the _what_; this skill is the _when_ - the gate you pass through right before any completion claim.

## The Iron Law

```text
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

If you have not run the verification command in this message, you cannot claim it passes. Not "should", not "probably", not "based on the diff".

## The gate function

Before writing "done" / "fixed" / "green" / "ready to merge" - even in your own head:

1. **Identify** - what exact command proves this claim?
2. **Run** - execute it fresh, complete, in this turn.
3. **Read** - full output, check exit code, count failures.
4. **Verify** - does the output actually confirm the claim?
5. **Only then** - make the claim, with the evidence attached.

Skip any step = you are lying to the user, not verifying.

## Common false claims → what they actually need

| Claim                    | Requires                                                                      | Not sufficient                                    |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Tests pass               | Fresh test run, exit 0, 0 failures                                            | "should pass", previous run, "logic looks right"  |
| Linter clean             | Linter output, 0 errors                                                       | Partial check, extrapolating from unrelated files |
| Build succeeds           | Build command, exit 0                                                         | Linter passing, editor squiggles gone             |
| Bug fixed                | Reproduce original symptom, watch it not happen                               | Code changed, "assumed" fixed                     |
| Regression test works    | Red → green cycle verified (revert fix, watch test fail, restore, watch pass) | Test passes once                                  |
| Agent/subagent completed | Read the VCS diff, verify claimed changes exist                               | Agent's own "success" report                      |
| Spec satisfied           | Line-by-line checklist against the plan                                       | "Tests pass, phase complete"                      |

## Red flags - you are about to claim without verifying

- Words like "should", "probably", "seems to", "looks good"
- Satisfaction language ("Great!", "Perfect!", "Done!") before running the command
- About to commit / push / open PR without a verification block in this turn
- Trusting a subagent's own success report
- "Just this once" thinking, or "I'm tired, close enough"
- Partial verification (linter passed, so build must)

## Rationalization prevention

| Excuse                                   | Reality                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| "Should work now"                        | RUN it.                                 |
| "I'm confident"                          | Confidence ≠ evidence.                  |
| "Linter passed"                          | Linter ≠ compiler ≠ tests.              |
| "The agent said success"                 | Read the diff yourself.                 |
| "Partial check is enough"                | Partial proves nothing about the whole. |
| "Different words, so rule doesn't apply" | Spirit over letter.                     |

## Patterns

**Tests**

- Run the test command. See `34/34 pass`. Then say "all tests pass".
- Never: "should pass now".

**Regression tests (real red-green)**

- Write test → run (pass) → revert fix → run (MUST FAIL) → restore fix → run (pass).
- Never: "I've added a regression test" without the red-green cycle.

**Build**

- Run the build. See exit 0. Then say "build passes".
- Never: "linter passed, build should too".

**Agent delegation**

- Subagent reports success → check the VCS diff → verify the claimed change is actually there → report actual state.
- Never: paste the agent's report and treat it as truth.

## When this fires

Always, before:

- Any variation of success / completion / fixed / passing / green
- Committing, opening a PR, marking a task done, handing off
- Moving to the next task
- Any positive statement about the work's state

## Pair with

- `adversarial-verify` - the 11 shortcuts agents take to fake "done"; run through the list, then run through this gate.
- `clean-commits` - clean commits require verified content.
- The `verifier` subagent - dispatch it; then verify its report against the diff (per the "Agent delegation" pattern above).

## The bottom line

Run the command. Read the output. THEN claim the result. Non-negotiable.
