# Decision Record (ADR)

Write a short file `docs/decisions/NNN-<slug>.md`:

- **Context** - what forced a decision. The constraints.
- **Options** - the 2-3 real candidates, one line each.
- **Decision** - what you picked, dated.
- **Why** - the tradeoff. What you gave up. "We picked Postgres over Mongo because we need real joins; we accept heavier ops."
- **Consequences** - what this now makes easy and hard.
  Hard-to-reverse choices (schema, auth, data store) MUST get one. Future-you will ask "why on earth did we do this" - answer it now.
