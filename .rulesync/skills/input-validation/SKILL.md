# Input Validation

Validate at the edge, before the data touches logic or storage.

- **Schema** - type, required fields, allowed values. Reject unknown fields rather than ignoring them.
- **Bounds** - string length, number ranges, array size. An unbounded input is a DoS and a memory bomb.
- **Format** - emails, UUIDs, dates parsed and re-validated, not trusted as strings.
- **Files** - size limit, type allowlist (check content, not just extension), no path traversal in names.
- Reject with a clear 4xx and a message that says what's wrong - without leaking internals.
  Never trust "it comes from our own frontend". The request can come from anywhere.
