# Spec First

Without an external contract, the agent drifts after ~3 iterations - and the failure looks like progress (code written, tests pass, wrong goal solved).
Write `PROMPT.md` BEFORE acting:

- **Goal** - one sentence.
- **Done when** - concrete, checkable conditions. "Test suite green: <cmd>".
- **Never touch** - files/areas off-limits.
- **Stop if** - more than N files outside scope change; a passing test starts failing.
  The agent re-reads this file every iteration. State (what's done) goes in a separate `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` it updates in place. If you can't write "done when" concretely, the task isn't ready - clarify before coding.
