# Accessibility Pass

- **Keyboard** - every interactive element reachable and operable by Tab/Enter/Esc. Modals trap focus and restore it on close.
- **Labels** - every input has a real `<label>`; icon-only buttons have `aria-label`.
- **Images** - meaningful `alt`; decorative images `alt=""`.
- **Contrast** - text ≥ 4.5:1 (3:1 for large). Don't encode meaning in color alone.
- **Semantics** - real `<button>`/`<a>`, not a clickable `<div>`. Headings in order.
- **Focus** - visible focus ring. Never `outline: none` without a replacement.
  Output: each failure with the element + the fix. Test it with Tab only, no mouse.
