# PR from Diff

A reviewer should understand the change without reading every line. Structure:

- **What & why** - the problem and the approach, 2-3 sentences.
- **Changes** - bullet the meaningful ones (skip noise like formatting).
- **How to verify** - the exact steps/commands the reviewer runs to confirm it works.
- **Risks / out of scope** - what could break, what you deliberately didn't do.
- **Screenshots** for UI.
  Flag any decision the reviewer should weigh in on. Keep the PR small - if the diff is huge, say what could be split out. No "fixes stuff".
