## Symlinks

Rulesync follows symbolic links when it discovers source files, whether you use a plain `.rulesync/` directory or a separate `--input-root`. Glob-based discovery (rules, commands, subagents, skills) follows symlinked files and directories; single fixed-path files such as `.rulesyncignore`, `.rulesync/mcp.json`, and `.rulesync/permissions.json` are likewise resolved transparently by the OS when read. A symlink inside the input tree that points elsewhere is followed transparently, and the resolved file content is copied into the generated output. This is intentional: it lets you centralize shared skills or rules in one place and reference them via symlinks without duplication (see [issue #1707](https://github.com/dyoshikawa/rulesync/issues/1707)).

The trust boundary is the directory you point Rulesync at. There is **no** `realpath`-based containment check on individual symlinks, so a link may resolve to a target outside the input root - enforcing containment would break the shared-file use case above. Only run Rulesync against trees you control. Directory symlink **cycles** are handled safely: results are deduplicated by real path, so a cycle does not produce duplicated output. Note that the remote-fetch path (`rulesync fetch` from a Git repository) is a separate, hardened code path that **skips** symlinks entirely, so untrusted remote content never has its symlinks followed.

## `rulesync/rules/*.md`

Example:

```md

# Rulesync Project Overview

This is Rulesync, a Node.js CLI tool that automatically generates configuration files for various AI development tools from unified AI rule files. The project enables teams to maintain consistent AI coding assistant rules across multiple tools.

...
```

> **Kiro note:** Kiro reads steering files from `.rulesync/steering/*.md` and uses an `inclusion` frontmatter block to decide when each is loaded (`always`, `fileMatch` with a `fileMatchPattern`, `manual`, or `auto` - which auto-includes the file when a request matches its companion `description`, keyed by `name`). Rulesync derives this for non-root steering files: an explicit `kiro.inclusion` block round-trips as-is (carrying `name`/`description` through for `auto`); otherwise specific (non-wildcard) `globs` map to `inclusion: fileMatch` (a single glob is written as a string and multiple as a YAML array, both of which Kiro accepts), so the rule applies only to matching files instead of always; otherwise the file stays always-on and is written without a frontmatter block (Kiro's no-frontmatter default). The root overview index is always written plain so Kiro always loads it. In **global** mode (`--global`), steering is written to `~/.rulesync/steering/` with the root rule as `~/.rulesync/steering/product.md` (Kiro does not read `~/AGENTS.md`, so the project-scope root `AGENTS.md` is not used at the home level), and global MCP is written to `~/.rulesync/settings/mcp.json`.

> **Kilo Code note:** Kilo writes the root rule to the auto-loaded `AGENTS.md` and non-root rules to `.kilo/rules/*.md`. Because Kilo v7 does not auto-load files under `.kilo/rules/`, Rulesync also registers each generated non-root rule file in the `instructions` array of the shared `kilo.jsonc` (the root `AGENTS.md` is auto-loaded and is therefore not registered). This merge is non-destructive: existing keys such as `mcp`, `tools`, and `permission` are preserved, and the `instructions` list is deduped and sorted.

> **OpenCode note:** OpenCode writes the root rule to the auto-loaded `AGENTS.md` and non-root rules to `.opencode/memories/*.md`. Because OpenCode auto-loads only the root `AGENTS.md` plus files explicitly listed in the `instructions` array of `opencode.json` (it does not auto-discover a rules directory), Rulesync also registers each generated non-root rule file in the `instructions` array of the shared `opencode.json`/`opencode.jsonc` (the root `AGENTS.md` is auto-loaded and is therefore not registered). This merge is non-destructive: existing keys such as `mcp`, `tools`, and `permission` are preserved, and the `instructions` list is deduped and sorted.

> **Qwen Code note:** Qwen Code writes the root rule to the auto-loaded `QWEN.md` (project) / `~/.qwen/QWEN.md` (global, via `--global`) as plain Markdown, and non-root rules to its path-based context-rule directory `.qwen/rules/` (project) / `~/.qwen/rules/` (global). Each non-root rule is a Markdown file with optional YAML frontmatter: Rulesync maps `globs` ⇄ Qwen's `paths` (a picomatch glob array) and `description` ⇄ `description`. A rule **with** specific `paths` is _conditional_ - Qwen lazily injects it only when the model touches a matching file - while a rule **without** `paths` (empty or wildcard `**/*`/`*` globs) is a _baseline_ rule loaded at session start and is written as plain Markdown with no frontmatter block. The `.qwen/rules/` directory supersedes the legacy `.qwen/memories/` import surface, so each rule is emitted to exactly one location; the root `QWEN.md` is unchanged. See the [Qwen Code memory/context docs](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code).

> **Cline note:** Cline writes the root rule to the auto-loaded `AGENTS.md` (project) as plain Markdown, and non-root rules to its flat `.clinerules/` directory. Each non-root rule is a Markdown file with optional YAML frontmatter for conditional activation: Rulesync maps `globs` ⇄ Cline's `paths` (a glob array; the rule loads only when a matching file is in context) and `description` ⇄ `description`. A rule with **specific** `globs` emits `paths`; a rule with **universal** globs (`**/*` or `*`) emits `alwaysApply: true` (always load); a rule **without** globs is written as plain Markdown with no frontmatter block (always active). In global mode (via `--global`), Cline rules are written to the cross-tool `~/.agents/AGENTS.md` (Cline CLI v3.0.15+) as plain Markdown. See the [Cline rules docs](https://docs.cline.bot/customization/cline-rules).

> **Pi note:** Pi writes the root rule to the auto-loaded `AGENTS.md` (project) / `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md` (global, via `--global`) as plain Markdown, and folds non-root rules into that single file (Pi has no modular rules directory). Pi additionally supports two system-prompt instruction files that Rulesync does **not** currently emit: `.pi/SYSTEM.md` (project) / `~/.pi/agent/SYSTEM.md` (global) **replaces** the default system prompt entirely, and `.pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` (project) / `~/.pi/agent/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` (global) **appends** to it. Rulesync's rules model only routes a designated `root` rule to a single context file and has no frontmatter convention for marking a rule as "replace the system prompt" versus "append to the system prompt", so these files are left to be authored by hand. See the [Pi usage docs](https://pi.dev/docs/latest/usage).

> **Reasonix note:** Reasonix auto-injects a hierarchical instruction document, reading its vendor-specific `REASONIX.md` (alongside the cross-tool `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`) by walking user-home → ancestors → project root/local. Rulesync writes the vendor `REASONIX.md` at the project root (project) / `~/.reasonix/REASONIX.md` (global, via `--global`) and folds non-root rules into that single file, since Reasonix has no modular rules directory. See the [Reasonix GUIDE](https://github.com/esengine/DeepSeek-Reasonix/blob/main-v2/docs/GUIDE.md).

## `.rulesync/hooks.json`

Hooks run scripts at lifecycle events (e.g. session start, before tool use). Events use **canonical camelCase** in this file, and Rulesync translates them per tool: Cursor uses them as-is; Claude Code, Factory Droid, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and Goose get PascalCase (with a few tool-specific name mappings) in their settings files; OpenCode and Kilo hooks are emitted as JavaScript plugins (`.opencode/plugins/rulesync-hooks.js`, `.kilo/plugins/rulesync-hooks.js`); Copilot and Copilot CLI map event names to their own camelCase (e.g. `beforeSubmitPrompt` → `userPromptSubmitted`, `stop` → `agentStop`, `afterError` → `errorOccurred`) and use `powershell`/`bash` command fields - Copilot CLI additionally covers a wider event set and supports `prompt` and `http` hook types beyond `command`; deepagents-cli uses a dot-notation (e.g. `session.start`, `tool.error`); Kiro emits hooks into `.rulesync/agents/default.json` using Kiro's CLI event names (`agentSpawn`, `userPromptSubmit`, `preToolUse`, `postToolUse`, `stop`); Qwen Code emits PascalCase events into the `hooks` key of `.qwen/settings.json` (its supported event set differs from Gemini CLI's).

Example:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "sessionStart": [
      { "type": "command", "command": ".rulesync/hooks/session-start.sh" }
    ],
    "preToolUse": [
      { "matcher": "Bash", "command": ".rulesync/hooks/confirm.sh" }
    ],
    "postToolUse": [
      { "matcher": "Write|Edit", "command": ".rulesync/hooks/format.sh" }
    ],
    "stop": [{ "command": ".rulesync/hooks/audit.sh" }]
  },
  "cursor": {
    "hooks": {
      "afterFileEdit": [{ "command": ".cursor/hooks/format.sh" }]
    }
  },
  "claudecode": {
    "hooks": {
      "notification": [
        {
          "matcher": "permission_prompt",
          "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/notify.sh"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "opencode": {
    "hooks": {
      "afterShellExecution": [{ "command": ".rulesync/hooks/post-shell.sh" }]
    }
  },
  "copilot": {
    "hooks": {
      "afterError": [{ "command": ".rulesync/hooks/report-error.sh" }]
    }
  }
}
```

**Top-level keys:**

- `version`: Schema version (currently `1`).
- `hooks`: Map of canonical event names to an array of hook entries. These are dispatched to every tool that supports the given event.
- `cursor.hooks`, `claudecode.hooks`, `opencode.hooks`, `kilo.hooks`, `copilot.hooks`, `copilotcli.hooks`, `factorydroid.hooks`, `codexcli.hooks`, `goose.hooks`, `deepagents.hooks`, `kiro.hooks`, `kiro-ide.hooks`, `qwencode.hooks`: Tool-specific **override keys**. Entries under these keys are emitted only for the corresponding tool, so tool-only events (e.g. `afterFileEdit` for Cursor/OpenCode/Kilo, `worktreeCreate` for Claude Code, `afterError` for Copilot/Copilot CLI, `PostFileSave`/`PreTaskExec` for Kiro IDE) can coexist with shared ones without leaking to other tools. `copilotcli.hooks` falls back to `copilot.hooks`, which in turn falls back to the shared `hooks` block.

**Hook entry keys:**

- `command` (required): Shell command to execute when the event fires.
- `type` (optional): Either `"command"` (default) or `"prompt"`. Not all tools support `prompt`; see notes below.
- `matcher` (optional): Regex used by tools that scope hooks to specific tool names (e.g. `preToolUse`, `postToolUse`, `notification`). Ignored by events that do not take a matcher (e.g. `sessionStart`, `worktreeCreate`, `worktreeRemove`).
- `timeout` (optional): Per-hook timeout in seconds, forwarded to tools that support it.
- `failClosed` (optional): Boolean. When `true`, a hook failure (crash, timeout, invalid JSON) blocks the action instead of allowing it through. Passed through to Cursor's `.cursor/hooks.json` and to JetBrains Junie's `~/.junie/config.json` (as Junie's equivalently-named `blockOnError` flag).
- `async` (optional): Boolean. When `true`, the hook command runs in the background without blocking. Forwarded to Qwen Code (`.qwen/settings.json`) and JetBrains Junie (`~/.junie/config.json`, same field name).

Events present in the shared `hooks` block but unsupported by a given tool are skipped for that tool (a warning is logged at generate time). The canonical `notification` event maps to deepagents-cli's `input.required` (human-in-the-loop interrupt).

> **Note:** `worktreeCreate`, `worktreeRemove`, `messageDisplay`, `postToolBatch`, `taskCreated`, `taskCompleted`, `teammateIdle`, and `cwdChanged` are Claude Code events that do not support the `matcher` field (they fire on every occurrence). Any matcher defined in the config is ignored for these events.

> **Note:** Rulesync implements OpenCode hooks as a plugin at `.opencode/plugins/rulesync-hooks.js` and Kilo hooks as a plugin at `.kilo/plugins/rulesync-hooks.js`, so importing from OpenCode/Kilo to rulesync is not supported. Both only support command-type hooks (not prompt-type).

> **Note:** GitHub Copilot's format uses separate `powershell` and `bash` fields for hooks. Rulesync supports only a single `command` field and resolves this by emitting the command under the `powershell` key on Windows, and under the `bash` key on all other platforms.

> **Note:** Hook file paths per tool:
>
> - **Copilot (cloud agent)** - `<project>/.github/hooks/copilot-hooks.json`.
> - **Copilot CLI** - project: `<project>/.github/hooks/copilotcli-hooks.json`; global: `~/.copilot/hooks/copilot-hooks.json`. The Copilot CLI docs let you choose any filename inside `.github/hooks/`, so Rulesync uses the CLI-specific name to avoid colliding with the cloud-agent file when both targets are enabled. The global path is a Rulesync convention; the official Copilot CLI documentation does not currently enumerate a global hooks location, so this placement may change if the spec later mandates an alternate layout. Copilot CLI uses a **wider event surface** than the shared cloud-agent set (`sessionStart`, `sessionEnd`, `userPromptSubmitted`, `preToolUse`, `postToolUse`, `postToolUseFailure`, `agentStop` ← `stop`, `subagentStart`, `subagentStop`, `errorOccurred` ← `afterError`, `preCompact`, `permissionRequest`, `notification`, `preMcpToolCall` ← `beforeMCPExecution`) and supports three hook types: **`command`** (`bash`/`powershell` with optional `timeoutSec`, plus pass-through `cwd`/`env`), **`prompt`** (a `prompt` string - Copilot CLI only honors prompt hooks on `sessionStart`, so prompt hooks on other events are dropped), and **`http`** (`url`/`headers`/`allowedEnvVars` with optional `timeoutSec`). On `preToolUse` / `postToolUse`, an entry's optional `matcher` field (a regex compiled as `^(?:PATTERN)$`, tested against the tool name) is emitted and round-tripped; on any other event a matcher is dropped (with a warning) because the CLI does not honor it there ([changelog v1.0.36, 2026-04-24](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli) and [v1.0.63, 2026-06-15](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli)).
> - **Antigravity IDE / Antigravity CLI** - project: `<project>/.agents/hooks.json`; global: `~/.gemini/config/hooks.json`. Both targets share the same dedicated `hooks.json` (a Claude-Code-style matcher map nested under a generated `rulesync` hook name), so enabling both writes the same file.
> - **Devin Desktop (formerly Windsurf)** - project: `<project>/.windsurf/hooks.json`; global: `~/.codeium/windsurf/hooks.json`. The Cascade Hooks file location is unchanged by the Devin Desktop rebrand.
> - **AugmentCode** - project: `<project>/.augment/settings.json`; global: `~/.augment/settings.json`. Hooks are merged under the top-level `hooks` key of the shared settings file (which also holds `toolPermissions`).
> - **Vibe Code** - project: `<project>/.vibe/hooks.toml`; global: `~/.vibe/hooks.toml`. Hooks are **experimental** and require `enable_experimental_hooks = true` in `.vibe/config.toml` (or `VIBE_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_HOOKS=true`); Rulesync merges this flag into the shared `.vibe/config.toml` without clobbering existing MCP/permissions settings.

> **Note:** Because each AI tool evolves its own hook surface at its own pace, the matrix above reflects the events Rulesync currently translates. When a tool ships a new event that Rulesync does not yet support, the most reliable path is to open an issue - the matrix is the intended baseline to compare against.

> **Note:** Kiro hooks are emitted into `.rulesync/agents/default.json` under the `hooks` field, merging with any existing agent configuration (tools, allowedTools, etc.). Both `sessionEnd` and `stop` canonical events map to Kiro CLI's `stop` event. Only `command`-type hooks are supported; `prompt`-type hooks are silently skipped. Kiro CLI uses `timeout_ms` (in milliseconds) for per-hook timeouts.

> **Note:** Antigravity (IDE and CLI) writes a dedicated `hooks.json` keyed by a **named hook** whose value holds the event map, e.g. `{ "rulesync": { "PreToolUse": [ { "matcher": "...", "hooks": [...] } ], "Stop": [ { "hooks": [...] } ] } }`. Rulesync emits a single generated hook under the stable name `rulesync`. It supports five lifecycle events - `preToolUse` ⇄ `PreToolUse`, `postToolUse` ⇄ `PostToolUse`, `preModelInvocation` ⇄ `PreInvocation`, `postModelInvocation` ⇄ `PostInvocation`, and `stop` ⇄ `Stop` - where `PreInvocation`/`PostInvocation`/`Stop` are matcher-less handler lists. On import, both the named-hook wrapper and a legacy flat top-level event map are accepted, and the optional per-hook `enabled` flag is ignored.

> **Note:** Devin Desktop (formerly Windsurf) Cascade Hooks (GA) are written to a dedicated `hooks.json` whose top-level `hooks` key maps each Cascade event name to a **flat array** of hook objects (no `matcher`, no `type`, no inner `hooks` wrapper, and no `timeout`). Each object carries `command` and/or `powershell`, plus optional `show_output` and `working_directory`. Rulesync splits the generic tool lifecycle into Devin's file/command/MCP-specific events, so the canonical events map bijectively: `beforeReadFile` ⇄ `pre_read_code`, `beforeTabFileRead` ⇄ `post_read_code`, `afterTabFileEdit` ⇄ `pre_write_code`, `afterFileEdit` ⇄ `post_write_code`, `beforeShellExecution` ⇄ `pre_run_command`, `afterShellExecution` ⇄ `post_run_command`, `beforeMCPExecution` ⇄ `pre_mcp_tool_use`, `afterMCPExecution` ⇄ `post_mcp_tool_use`, `beforeSubmitPrompt` ⇄ `pre_user_prompt`, `afterAgentResponse` ⇄ `post_cascade_response`, `beforeAgentResponse` ⇄ `post_cascade_response_with_transcript`, and `worktreeCreate` ⇄ `post_setup_worktree`. Canonical events with no Devin equivalent (e.g. `sessionStart`, `stop`) are dropped with a logged warning. The Cascade Hooks file location (`.windsurf/hooks.json` / `~/.codeium/windsurf/hooks.json`) is retained from the Windsurf era and is unaffected by the rebrand.

> **Note:** AugmentCode (Auggie CLI) hooks are merged under the top-level `hooks` key of the shared `.augment/settings.json` (project) / `~/.augment/settings.json` (global), mirroring Claude Code's per-event matcher arrays (`{ "EventName": [ { "matcher": "...", "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "...", "timeout": ... } ] } ] }`). The `hooks` block is merged in place so it coexists with the `toolPermissions` block from the permissions feature. Five lifecycle events are supported - `preToolUse` ⇄ `PreToolUse`, `postToolUse` ⇄ `PostToolUse`, `sessionStart` ⇄ `SessionStart`, `sessionEnd` ⇄ `SessionEnd`, and `stop` ⇄ `Stop`. The `matcher` field (a case-sensitive regex, default `.*`, with `mcp:*` support) applies only to the tool events `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse`; any matcher on the session events is dropped with a logged warning. Commands are emitted verbatim - Auggie exposes `AUGMENT_PROJECT_DIR` as a runtime environment variable, not as an inline command substitution, so no directory prefix is added. Only `command`-type hooks are supported. On **import** (project scope), Rulesync also reads the layered overrides file `<workspace>/.augment/settings.local.json` - a gitignored, machine-specific file that Auggie merges on top of `settings.json` - and combines it over the base settings before importing, following Auggie's documented layering (simple values take the local override, `mcpServers`/`plugins` replace wholesale, and other objects/lists - including the `hooks` events - are combined across tiers), so personal hook overrides are picked up without dropping base events. This overlay is **import-only and project-only**: Rulesync never writes `settings.local.json`, AugmentCode documents no global `~/.augment/settings.local.json`, so the overlay is skipped in global mode.

> **Note:** Vibe Code (mistral-vibe) hooks are **experimental** and written to a dedicated `.vibe/hooks.toml` (project) / `~/.vibe/hooks.toml` (global) as a flat `[[hooks]]` TOML array. Each entry carries its own event `type`, a `command`, and optional `name`, `timeout` (seconds, default 60), and `description`. Tool-hook entries (`before_tool` / `after_tool`) additionally carry a tool-name `match` (an fnmatch glob like `bash`/`mcp_*` or a `re:`-prefixed regex, case-insensitive - the canonical `matcher` field; `*` means "any tool") and an optional `strict` flag; `post_agent_turn` carries neither. Three events are supported - `preToolUse` ⇄ `before_tool`, `postToolUse` ⇄ `after_tool`, and `stop` ⇄ `post_agent_turn` (fires after every assistant turn that ends without pending tool calls). Only `command`-type hooks are emitted. Hooks require `enable_experimental_hooks = true` in `.vibe/config.toml`; Rulesync merges this flag into the existing config file (preserving MCP/permissions keys) as an auxiliary file and never deletes `.vibe/config.toml`.

> **Note:** Goose hooks follow the Open Plugins spec: Rulesync writes a plugin directory `hooks/hooks.json` that Goose auto-discovers at startup. Locations are `<project>/.agents/plugins/rulesync/hooks/hooks.json` (project) and `~/.agents/plugins/rulesync/hooks/hooks.json` (global). The JSON shape matches Claude Code's (`{ "hooks": { "EventName": [ { "matcher": "...", "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "..." } ] } ] } }`). Eleven lifecycle events are supported - `sessionStart` ⇄ `SessionStart`, `sessionEnd` ⇄ `SessionEnd`, `stop` ⇄ `Stop`, `beforeSubmitPrompt` ⇄ `UserPromptSubmit`, `preToolUse` ⇄ `PreToolUse`, `postToolUse` ⇄ `PostToolUse`, `postToolUseFailure` ⇄ `PostToolUseFailure`, `beforeReadFile` ⇄ `BeforeReadFile`, `afterFileEdit` ⇄ `AfterFileEdit`, `beforeShellExecution` ⇄ `BeforeShellExecution`, and `afterShellExecution` ⇄ `AfterShellExecution` - matching Goose's `HookEvent` enum exactly (it has no `SubagentStart`/`SubagentStop`). The `matcher` regex is preserved, commands are emitted verbatim (Goose exposes `PLUGIN_ROOT` as a runtime environment variable), and only `command`-type hooks are supported.

> **Note:** Qwen Code hooks are written under the top-level `hooks` key of `.qwen/settings.json` (project) / `~/.qwen/settings.json` (global), using Claude-style PascalCase per-matcher arrays (`{ "EventName": [ { "matcher": "...", "sequential": false, "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "...", "timeout": ... } ] } ] }`). Qwen's supported event set **differs from Gemini CLI's**, so rulesync defines a Qwen-specific mapping. Sixteen lifecycle events are supported - `sessionStart` ⇄ `SessionStart`, `sessionEnd` ⇄ `SessionEnd`, `preToolUse` ⇄ `PreToolUse`, `postToolUse` ⇄ `PostToolUse`, `postToolUseFailure` ⇄ `PostToolUseFailure`, `beforeSubmitPrompt` ⇄ `UserPromptSubmit`, `stop` ⇄ `Stop`, `stopFailure` ⇄ `StopFailure`, `subagentStart` ⇄ `SubagentStart`, `subagentStop` ⇄ `SubagentStop`, `preCompact` ⇄ `PreCompact`, `postCompact` ⇄ `PostCompact`, `permissionRequest` ⇄ `PermissionRequest`, `notification` ⇄ `Notification`, `todoCreated` ⇄ `TodoCreated`, and `todoCompleted` ⇄ `TodoCompleted`. Commands are emitted verbatim (no `$GEMINI_PROJECT_DIR` rewriting). Qwen's four hook types are supported: `command`, `prompt`, `http` (which carries a `url` and POSTs JSON to it; the type and URL round-trip), and `function`. Per-hook fields added in [Qwen Code PR #2827](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/pull/2827) round-trip as well: command hooks carry `async` (run in the background), `env` (extra subprocess environment variables), and `shell` (`bash`/`powershell`); http hooks carry `headers` (with `${VAR}` interpolation), `allowedEnvVars` (the env-var allowlist), and `once` (single execution per event per session); `statusMessage` (progress text) applies to both. Command-only fields are emitted only on command hooks and http-only fields only on http hooks. The group-level `sequential` flag (parallel by default) and the top-level `disableAllHooks` switch are both round-tripped, and other top-level keys in `settings.json` are preserved. See the [Qwen Code hooks docs](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/blob/main/docs/users/features/hooks.md).

> **Note:** Reasonix hooks are written to a dedicated `.reasonix/settings.json` (project) / `~/.reasonix/settings.json` (global) - a Claude-Code-style but standalone JSON file, separate from the `[permissions]`/`[[plugins]]` TOML config. Unlike Claude Code, each event key maps directly to a **flat array** of hook objects (no `matcher`/`hooks` wrapper): `{ "EventName": [ { "match": "...", "command": "...", "description": "...", "timeout": ... } ] }`. Eight of Reasonix's ten documented events are mapped - `preToolUse` ⇄ `PreToolUse`, `postToolUse` ⇄ `PostToolUse`, `beforeSubmitPrompt` ⇄ `UserPromptSubmit`, `stop` ⇄ `Stop`, `sessionStart` ⇄ `SessionStart`, `sessionEnd` ⇄ `SessionEnd`, `subagentStop` ⇄ `SubagentStop`, and `postModelInvocation` ⇄ `PostLLMCall` - while `Notification` and `PreCompact` have no canonical rulesync event and are left out. `match` (Reasonix's matcher field name) is honored only on `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse`; a matcher on any other event is dropped with a warning. The canonical `timeout` field is documented in seconds, while Reasonix's `timeout` is milliseconds, so rulesync converts (`× 1000` on generate, `÷ 1000` on import). Only `command`-type hooks are supported. The `settings.json` file is not documented as holding anything besides hooks today, but rulesync merges non-destructively and never deletes it, in case a future Reasonix version adds other keys. See the [Reasonix Hooks guide](https://github.com/esengine/DeepSeek-Reasonix/blob/main-v2/docs/DESKTOP_HOOKS.zh-CN.md).

## `.github/mcp.json` and `.copilot/mcp-config.json`

Example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "serena": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/oraios/serena",
        "serena",
        "start-mcp-server"
      ]
    },
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    },
    "local-dev": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["scripts/start-local-mcp.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

This file is used by the GitHub Copilot CLI for MCP server configuration. Rulesync manages it by converting from the unified `.rulesync/mcp.json` format. Both scopes use the same `{ "mcpServers": {...} }` shape but write to different paths:

- **Project mode:** `.github/mcp.json` (relative to project root) - the Copilot CLI auto-loads MCP servers from this workspace config file ([changelog v1.0.61, 2026-06-09](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli)).
- **Global mode:** `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` (relative to home directory) - the personal/global MCP configuration.

> **Migration note:** earlier Rulesync versions wrote the **project-mode** Copilot CLI MCP config to `.copilot/mcp-config.json` (the same path used for global mode). Project mode now writes the dedicated workspace file `.github/mcp.json` instead, so a previously generated project-scope `.copilot/mcp-config.json` is no longer managed and can be removed by hand.

Rulesync preserves explicit `type` values for `http`, `sse`, and `local` servers. For command-based servers that omit a transport type, Rulesync emits the mandatory `"type": "stdio"` field required by the Copilot CLI.

## `rulesync/commands/*.md`

Example:

```md
---
description: "Review a pull request" # command description
targets: ["*"] # * = all, or specific tools
copilot: # copilot specific parameters (optional)
  description: "Review a pull request"
  agent: "agent" # (optional) VS Code prompt-file agent: "ask", "agent", "plan", or a custom agent name (replaces the deprecated "mode")
antigravity: # antigravity specific parameters
  trigger: "/review" # Specific trigger for workflow (renames file to review.md)
  turbo: true # (Optional, default: true) Append // turbo for auto-execution
takt: # takt specific parameters (optional; emitted under .takt/facets/instructions/)
  name: "renamed-stem" # (optional) override the emitted filename stem (no path separators or "..")
  extends: "base" # (optional) emit a leading `{extends:<parent>}` facet-inheritance directive (Takt 0.39.0+)
pi: # pi coding agent specific parameters (optional)
  argument-hint: "[message]" # Hint shown in Pi's command palette
codexcli: # Codex CLI custom-prompt specific parameters (optional)
  argument-hint: "[message]" # Hint shown for the custom prompt's arguments
roo: # Roo Code specific parameters (optional)
  mode: "architect" # (optional) mode slug to switch to before running the command body (e.g. "code", "architect")
---

target_pr = $ARGUMENTS

If target_pr is not provided, use the PR of the current branch.

Execute the following in parallel:

...
```

The command body itself uses a Claude Code-compatible **universal syntax** (e.g. `$ARGUMENTS`, `` !`cmd` ``). When a target tool expects a different placeholder syntax, rulesync translates it automatically on generation and reverses the translation on import. See [Command Syntax](./command-syntax.md) for the full mapping.

> **Codex CLI deprecation note:** Codex CLI's own docs now state "Custom prompts are deprecated. Use skills for reusable instructions" (see [Custom Prompts](https://developers.openai.com/codex/custom-prompts)). Rulesync's `codexcli` commands still generate the global-only `~/.codex/prompts/*.md` custom-prompt files described above - they remain functional and no removal date has been announced, so this behavior is unchanged for now. For new reusable instructions, prefer rulesync's `codexcli` skills support (see `.rulesync/skills/*/SKILL.md` below) instead.

> **Qwen Code note:** Custom commands are emitted as **Markdown** files (not TOML - TOML is deprecated upstream) under `.qwen/commands/` (project) and `~/.qwen/commands/` (global, via `--global`). The file is an optional YAML frontmatter block (`description`) followed by the prompt body. Subdirectory namespacing is supported: `.qwen/commands/git/commit.md` becomes the `/git:commit` command. Any extra fields are preserved on round-trip under the `qwencode:` block.

> **OpenCode import note:** OpenCode lets commands live both as Markdown files under `.opencode/commands/*.md` **and** inline in `opencode.json`/`opencode.jsonc` under the top-level `command` key. On import, rulesync reads both: each inline entry's `template` becomes the command body and its `description`/`agent`/`model`/`subtask` fields become frontmatter. A Markdown file takes precedence over an inline entry with the same name.

> **Reasonix note:** Custom slash commands are Markdown files under `.reasonix/commands/` (project) / `~/.reasonix/commands/` (global, via `--global`) - directly analogous to Claude Code's `.claude/commands/`, since Reasonix explicitly mirrors Claude Code's conventions. Frontmatter supports `description` and `argument-hint`, and the body uses the same `$ARGUMENTS` / `$1`…`$N` placeholder syntax. Subdirectory namespacing is supported (`git/commit.md` → `/git:commit`). Any extra fields are preserved on round-trip under the `reasonix:` block. See the [Reasonix GUIDE](https://github.com/esengine/DeepSeek-Reasonix/blob/main-v2/docs/GUIDE.md#slash-commands).

> **Rovo Dev CLI note:** Rovo Dev's "saved prompts" are a file-based custom-command surface made of a `prompts.yml` manifest plus per-prompt Markdown content files, invoked via `/prompts [title] [extra]`. Rulesync writes the content (no frontmatter) to `.rovodev/prompts/<name>.md` (project) / `~/.rovodev/prompts/<name>.md` (global, via `--global`), and rebuilds the sibling `.rovodev/prompts.yml` / `~/.rovodev/prompts.yml` manifest with one `{ name, description, content_file }` entry per prompt, `content_file` pointing at `prompts/<name>.md` (resolved relative to `prompts.yml`, matching Rovo Dev's own resolution order). The `prompts` array is fully replaced from the current rulesync commands on each generate (mirrors the Rovodev MCP adapter fully replacing `mcpServers`); any other top-level key in an existing manifest is preserved, and the manifest is never deleted. See the [saved prompts](https://support.atlassian.com/rovo/docs/save-and-reuse-a-prompt-in-rovo-dev-cli/) and [CLI commands](https://support.atlassian.com/rovo/docs/rovo-dev-cli-commands/) docs.

You are the planner for any tasks.

Based on the user's instruction, create a plan while analyzing the related files. Then, report the plan in detail. You can output files to @tmp/ if needed.

Attention, again, you are just the planner, so though you can read any files and run any commands for analysis, please don't write any code.
```

> **Qwen Code note:** Subagents are emitted as Markdown + YAML frontmatter under `.qwen/agents/` (project) and `~/.qwen/agents/` (user/global, via `--global`); the body is the subagent's system prompt. Besides the shared `name`/`description`, the `qwencode:` block accepts these optional fields (all preserved on round-trip): `model`, `approvalMode` (`default` | `plan` | `auto-edit` | `yolo` | `bubble`), `tools` (allowlist), `disallowedTools` (denylist), `maxTurns`, `color`, `mcpServers` (per-agent MCP overrides - accepts both a record of server specs, matching Qwen's documented shape, and a plain array of server names), and `hooks` (per-agent hook registrations). See the [Qwen Code sub-agents docs](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/blob/main/docs/users/features/sub-agents.md).

> **Cline note:** Cline file-based agents are emitted as YAML files (`<name>.yaml`) into `.cline/agents/` (project) and `~/.cline/agents/` (global, via `--global`). The file is a YAML frontmatter block (`name` required, `description`) followed by the system prompt body, matching Cline's agent config loader.

> **Devin note:** Devin Local custom subagent profiles are emitted as `AGENT.md` files in a **directory-per-agent** layout: `.devin/agents/<name>/AGENT.md` (project) and `~/.config/devin/agents/<name>/AGENT.md` (global, via `--global`). The directory name `<name>` is the profile id (derived from the rulesync subagent file name). The `AGENT.md` is a YAML frontmatter block followed by the subagent's system prompt. Besides the shared `name`/`description`, the `devin` subagent block accepts these optional fields (all preserved on round-trip): `model` (string, override the subagent LLM), `allowed-tools` (list of strings, restrict available tools), `permissions` (object with `allow`/`deny`/`ask` string lists, override tool permissions), and `max-nesting` (integer, enable nested subagent spawning up to the given depth). See the [Devin subagents docs](https://docs.devin.ai/cli/subagents).

> **Roo note (as of 2026-06-16):** Roo Code reads project custom modes from a single aggregated `.roomodes` file at the workspace root (YAML; JSON also accepted). Rulesync therefore collapses every Roo-targeted subagent into that file's `customModes` array - each subagent becomes one mode whose `slug` is derived from the file name (sanitized to `^[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$`), `name`/`description` come from the shared frontmatter, and `roleDefinition` is the subagent body. The optional `roo:` block supplies `groups` (defaults to `["read", "edit", "command", "mcp"]`), `whenToUse`, `customInstructions`, an explicit `slug`, and a `roleDefinition` override. (Roo's previous `.roo/subagents/` output was inert - Roo Code never read it.) See the [Roo custom-modes docs](https://roocodeinc.github.io/Roo-Code/features/custom-modes).

> **OpenCode import note:** OpenCode lets agents live both as Markdown files under `.opencode/agents/*.md` **and** inline in `opencode.json`/`opencode.jsonc` under the top-level `agent` key. On import, rulesync reads both: each inline entry's `prompt` becomes the subagent body (a `"{file:./path}"` reference is resolved relative to the config file's location, as OpenCode does), and the remaining fields (`description`/`mode`/`model`/`tools`/`permission`/...) become frontmatter under the `opencode:` block. A Markdown file takes precedence over an inline entry with the same name.

> **Kilo note (as of 2026-05-13):** Kilo's documented default for user-defined agents is `mode: all`, which makes the agent available both as a top-level pick and as a subagent. Set `kilo.mode: subagent` to opt into hidden/subagent-only behavior.

Besides `mode`, the `kilo` subagent block accepts these optional fields (all preserved on round-trip):

| Field         | Type             | Notes                                                                            |

This is the skill body content.

You can provide instructions, context, or any information that helps the AI agent understand and execute this skill effectively.

The skill can include:

- Step-by-step instructions
- Code examples
- Best practices
- Any relevant context

Skills are directory-based and can include additional files alongside SKILL.md.

When `claudecode.scheduled-task: true` is set, that skill is emitted only as a Claude Code scheduled task and is not emitted to other tools even if `targets` contains `"*"`.
```

> **Note:** `claudecode.disallowed-tools` (a space/comma-separated string or a YAML list) removes the listed tools from the model while the skill is active. The same field is available on Claude Code slash commands. Both round-trip through the `claudecode` frontmatter section.

> **Note:** Codex CLI reads UI metadata, invocation policy, and tool dependencies from an `agents/openai.yaml` sidecar next to `SKILL.md` (Codex's `SKILL.md` frontmatter only carries `name` and `description`). When `codexcli.interface`, `codexcli.policy`, or `codexcli.dependencies` is present, Rulesync emits `.agents/skills/<name>/agents/openai.yaml` and reads it back on import. If the sidecar is emitted and `interface.short_description` is absent, the legacy `codexcli.short-description` is routed there. See the [Codex skills docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills.md).

> **Reasonix note:** Reasonix discovers Anthropic-style directory-layout skills (`<name>/SKILL.md`) under `.reasonix/skills/` (project) / `~/.reasonix/skills/` (global, via `--global`). Rulesync emits the portable `name`/`description` frontmatter (Reasonix supports additional optional keys, but only that pair is modeled); the schema is loose, so any extra keys on an imported `SKILL.md` survive the round-trip. See the [Reasonix GUIDE](https://github.com/esengine/DeepSeek-Reasonix/blob/main-v2/docs/GUIDE.md).

## `.rulesync/mcp.json`

Example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "$schema": "https://github.com/dyoshikawa/rulesync/releases/latest/download/mcp-schema.json",
    "serena": {
      "description": "Code analysis and semantic search MCP server",
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/oraios/serena",
        "serena",
        "start-mcp-server",
        "--context",
        "ide-assistant",
        "--enable-web-dashboard",
        "false",
        "--project",
        "."
      ],
      "env": {}
    },
    "context7": {
      "description": "Library documentation search server",
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

#### JSON Schema Support

Rulesync provides a JSON Schema for editor validation and autocompletion. Add the `$schema` property to your `.rulesync/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://github.com/dyoshikawa/rulesync/releases/latest/download/mcp-schema.json",
  "mcpServers": {}
}
```

### Transport types (`type` / `transport`)

The `type` (and the equivalent `transport`) field accepts `local`, `stdio`, `sse`, `http`, `ws`, and `streamable-http`. `streamable-http` is the MCP specification's name for the HTTP transport and is accepted as an alias of `http`, so configurations copied from a server's documentation work unchanged. `ws` is the WebSocket transport (a persistent bidirectional connection) and accepts the same `url`/`headers`/`headersHelper`/`timeout` fields as `http`. Tools that do not recognize a given transport keep it on round-trip but may ignore it at runtime.

> **Kilo Code note:** Kilo's MCP config uses its own native shape in `kilo.jsonc` (`type: "local" | "remote"`, `environment`, `enabled`, `command` as an array). Rulesync maps `stdio`/`local` ⇄ Kilo `local` and `http`/`sse` ⇄ Kilo `remote`; on import, Kilo `remote` is normalized to the canonical `http` transport (the deprecated `sse` is no longer emitted). The Kilo-specific `timeout` (local + remote, a positive integer in milliseconds) and `oauth` (remote only - either an OAuth-config object or `false` to disable auto-detection) fields are preserved on round-trip. The `kilo.jsonc` `skills` config key (`skills.paths` for extra skill locations and `skills.urls` for remote skill manifests) is likewise preserved when Rulesync writes the file.

> **Takt note (partial / transport-allowlist only):** Takt does **not** have a project- or global-level registry of MCP server _definitions_. The concrete `mcp_servers` map (`command`/`args`/`env` or `type`/`url`/`headers`) is declared **per workflow step** inside individual workflow YAML files; there is no top-level `mcp_servers` key in `config.yaml`, and Takt's config loader hard-rejects unknown top-level keys (introduced with MCP support in [Takt v0.21.0](https://github.com/nrslib/takt/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)). What `config.yaml` _does_ hold is the **default-deny transport allowlist** `workflow_mcp_servers: { stdio, sse, http }` - without it, workflow-defined MCP servers are refused regardless of how they are declared. So Rulesync emits **only** this allowlist into the shared `.takt/config.yaml` (project) / `~/.takt/config.yaml` (global), enabling exactly the transports your `.rulesync/mcp.json` servers use (`local`/`stdio` ⇒ `stdio`; `sse` ⇒ `sse`; `http`/`streamable-http`/`ws` ⇒ `http`). The merge is in place - every other top-level key (`provider`, `provider_profiles`, …) is preserved and the file is never deleted. **Documented lossiness:** per-server names, commands, env, URLs, and headers are not representable in `config.yaml` and are intentionally **not** written; you still declare the concrete servers in your workflow YAML steps, and Rulesync only opens the transport gate that permits them. As a corollary, **import** cannot reconstruct server definitions from a transport allowlist and yields an empty `mcpServers` map. See the [Takt configuration docs](https://github.com/nrslib/takt/blob/main/docs/configuration.md).

### MCP Tool Config (`enabledTools` / `disabledTools`)

You can control which individual tools from an MCP server are enabled or disabled using `enabledTools` and `disabledTools` arrays per server.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "serena": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/oraios/serena",
        "serena",
        "start-mcp-server"
      ],
      "enabledTools": ["search_symbols", "find_references"],
      "disabledTools": ["rename_symbol"]
    }
  }
}
```

- `enabledTools`: An array of tool names that should be explicitly enabled for this server.
- `disabledTools`: An array of tool names that should be explicitly disabled for this server.

> **Qwen Code note:** MCP servers are written to the `mcpServers` key of `.qwen/settings.json` (project) / `~/.qwen/settings.json` (global, via `--global`). Qwen supports stdio (`command`/`args`), SSE (`url`), and HTTP (`httpUrl`) transports. Rulesync maps the canonical per-server `enabledTools` ⇄ Qwen's `includeTools` (allowlist) and `disabledTools` ⇄ Qwen's `excludeTools` (denylist). Other top-level keys in `settings.json` are preserved on round-trip.

### Codex-specific: pass shell env vars to MCP servers (`envVars`)

Codex CLI supports a per-server array of shell env var names to inherit when launching the MCP server process. The source schema uses `envVars` (camelCase, matching the project convention used by sibling fields like `enabledTools`/`disabledTools`); the codex generator renames it to `env_vars` (snake_case) for codex's native `config.toml` format.

This is distinct from `env` (which is a literal `{name: value}` map) - `envVars` is a list of names whose **values come from the user's environment at runtime**. Both fields may coexist on the same server.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pal": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server.git",
        "pal-mcp-server"
      ],
      "envVars": ["OPENAI_API_KEY", "OPENROUTER_API_KEY", "GEMINI_API_KEY"]
    }
  }
}
```

Generated `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.pal]
type = "stdio"
command = "uvx"
args = ["--from", "git+https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server.git", "pal-mcp-server"]
env_vars = ["OPENAI_API_KEY", "OPENROUTER_API_KEY", "GEMINI_API_KEY"]
```

- Emitted only into the codex CLI output. Stripped from `RulesyncMcp.getMcpServers()` so it does not appear in other tools' generated configs (Claude Code, Kilo, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Cline, Junie, Factorydroid, Rovodev, etc.).
- Use this for secrets and API keys you do not want literal-encoded into a committed `mcp.json`.
- Precedence: codex CLI resolves these names from the user's runtime shell environment. If a name is also set in `env` (literal value), the codex CLI behavior is upstream-defined; see the [Codex configuration reference](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference#mcp_serversid-env_vars) (last checked 2026-05-13) for the exact resolution rule.

#### Codex-specific: OAuth client id (`oauth.clientId` → `client_id`)

A server's `oauth` block is preserved in the canonical Claude Code shape (camelCase `clientId`), but Codex CLI reads the OAuth client id from snake_case `oauth.client_id`. Without it, `codex mcp login <server>` falls back to dynamic client registration and fails for providers that do not support it (e.g. Slack). The codex generator therefore **duplicates** `clientId` into a sibling `client_id`, keeping the camelCase key so tools that expect it keep working:

```toml
[mcp_servers.slack.oauth]
clientId = "1601185624273.8899143856786"
client_id = "1601185624273.8899143856786"
callbackPort = 3118
```

Only a string `clientId` is duplicated (a non-string value would not be a usable OAuth client id), and an explicit `client_id` already present in the source is left untouched. On import, `client_id` collapses back to the canonical `clientId` (and is dropped when both are present) so the round-trip stays stable.

> **Grok CLI note:** MCP servers are written to a `[mcp_servers.<name>]` table in `.grok/config.toml` (project) / `~/.grok/config.toml` (global, via `--global`). The file is treated as shared Grok config: Rulesync only replaces the `mcp_servers` key and preserves every other table on round-trip, and it is never deleted. Unlike Codex CLI, Grok uses a literal `env` table (it does not support the `env_vars` runtime-passthrough list) and has no per-server tool allow/deny lists, so the only field rename is `disabled` (rulesync) ⇄ `enabled = false` (grok); an active server simply omits `enabled`. Servers with no environment variables are emitted without a dangling `[mcp_servers.<name>.env]` table (empty nested tables are stripped), and a server whose entire configuration would be empty is dropped with a warning.

### Goose-specific: MCP servers as `extensions` (global) and open-plugin manifest (project)

Goose configures MCP servers in two locations depending on scope:

- **Global (`--global`):** MCP servers are written as **extensions** in the shared user config `~/.config/goose/config.yaml`. The schema is non-standard, so Rulesync maps canonical MCP fields to Goose's: `command` → `cmd` (an array `command` folds its tail into `args`), `env` → `envs`, `url`/`httpUrl` → `uri`, and `disabled: true` → `enabled: false`. The `type` is derived - `command` ⇒ `stdio`, a remote `url` ⇒ `streamable_http` (or `sse` when the canonical `type` is `sse`). Each extension also carries its own `name`. Generation merges the `extensions:` block into the existing `config.yaml`, preserving other Goose settings (model, provider, ...), and the file is never deleted. This location supports **both stdio and remote** (http/sse) servers.
- **Project:** Goose v1.39.0+ discovers MCP extensions in **open plugins** at `<project>/.agents/plugins/<name>/.mcp.json` (and `~/.agents/plugins/<name>/.mcp.json` at user scope). Rulesync emits `.agents/plugins/rulesync/.mcp.json`, reusing the same `.agents/plugins/rulesync/` tree already used for Goose hooks. The manifest uses the **Claude-style** `{ "mcpServers": { "<name>": { "command", "args", "env", "cwd" } } }` shape. This manifest is **stdio-only** - it cannot express `url`/`headers`, so **remote (http/sse) servers are skipped with a warning** in project mode; sync them with `--global` to `~/.config/goose/config.yaml` instead. The `.mcp.json` manifest is owned by Rulesync and is deleted when no servers remain.

See the [Goose extensions docs](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/getting-started/using-extensions/) and [open-plugins MCP PR #9471](https://github.com/block/goose/pull/9471).

### Goose-specific: commands and subagents as recipes

Goose [recipes](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/recipes/recipe-reference/) are reusable YAML workflow files (`version`, `title`, `description`, plus at least one of `instructions` / `prompt`, and optional `extensions`, `parameters`, `sub_recipes`, …). Rulesync maps:

- **commands → top-level recipes** at `.goose/recipes/<name>.yaml` (project) and `~/.config/goose/recipes/<name>.yaml` (global). The command body becomes the recipe `prompt`.
- **subagents → sub-recipes** at `.goose/recipes/subagents/<name>.yaml` (project) and `~/.config/goose/recipes/subagents/<name>.yaml` (global), referenced from a parent recipe's `sub_recipes` list by relative `path`. The subagent body becomes the recipe `instructions`.

Subagents live in the `subagents/` subdirectory so the command-recipe and subagent-recipe file sets stay disjoint (import and orphan deletion never cross over). `title` defaults to the file name and `description` to the rulesync `description` (falling back to `title`) since recipes require both; `version` defaults to `1.0.0`. Any other recipe field round-trips through the rulesync `goose` section of a command/subagent.

### Vibe-specific: stdio `cwd` and MCP `[auth]` block

Vibe (mistral-vibe) MCP servers live in `[[mcp_servers]]` arrays of the shared `.vibe/config.toml`. In addition to the flat fields, Rulesync passes through the stdio `cwd` (working directory) and a structured per-server `auth` block (Vibe v2.15.0+). The `auth` table is discriminated on `type`: `static` (`headers`, `api_key_env`, `api_key_header`, `api_key_format`) and `oauth` (`scopes`, `client_id` / `client_metadata_url`, `redirect_port`). Because Vibe rejects mixing legacy top-level static-auth keys with an explicit `[auth]` block, Rulesync suppresses the legacy keys (`headers`/`api_key_env`/`api_key_header`/`api_key_format`) whenever a server carries an `auth` block. See [mistral-vibe](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe) (`vibe/core/config/_settings.py`).

> **Reasonix note:** MCP servers are written as `[[plugins]]` array-of-tables entries (Reasonix's MCP-compatible external plugins) in `reasonix.toml` (project) / `~/.reasonix/config.toml` (global, via `--global`). Each entry carries a `name` plus the standard transport fields: `type` selects the transport (`stdio` default - `command`/`args`/`env`; `http`, a.k.a. `streamable-http` - `url`/`headers`), and the deprecated `sse` transport is collapsed onto `http`. The file is treated as shared Reasonix config: Rulesync only replaces the `plugins` key and preserves every other table (providers, ui, agent, …) on round-trip, and it is never deleted. Reasonix has no per-server tool allow/deny lists, but each plugin entry may carry an optional `trusted_read_only_tools` array (raw MCP tool names pre-seeded as trusted for planner/read-only use); it also supports `call_timeout_seconds` (a per-server MCP call timeout) and `tool_timeout_seconds` (a per-tool inline table keyed by raw MCP tool name). None of these have a deep canonical mapping, so they round-trip as passthrough fields on the canonical MCP server object. See the [Reasonix plugins guide](https://github.com/esengine/deepseek-reasonix/blob/main-v2/docs/GUIDE.md#plugins-mcp) and [SPEC.md](https://github.com/esengine/DeepSeek-Reasonix/blob/main-v2/docs/SPEC.md) (`[[plugins]]` schema).

## `.rulesync/.aiignore` or `.rulesyncignore`

Rulesync supports a single ignore list that can live in either location below:

- `.rulesync/.aiignore` (recommended)
- `.rulesyncignore` (project root)

Rules and behavior:

- You may use either location.
- When both exist, Rulesync prefers `.rulesync/.aiignore` (recommended) over `.rulesyncignore` (legacy) when reading.
- If neither file exists yet, Rulesync defaults to creating `.rulesync/.aiignore`.

Notes:

- Running `rulesync init` will create `.rulesync/.aiignore` if no ignore file is present.

Example:

```ignore
tmp/
credentials/
```

### Where ignore patterns are written per tool

Most tools get a dedicated ignore file (for example `.cursorignore`,
`.geminiignore`, `.clineignore`). Antigravity CLI is built on the same engine
as Gemini CLI, so it reads the project-root `.geminiignore` file. Claude Code is the exception: it does not
read a separate ignore file, so Rulesync writes the deny list into Claude
Code's settings file as `permissions.deny` entries (`Read(<pattern>)`).

For Cursor, Rulesync emits only `.cursorignore` - the file that **blocks access
entirely** (semantic search, Tab, Agent, Inline Edit, and `@`-mentions). Cursor
also supports a second file, `.cursorindexingignore`, which excludes files from
**indexing only** while keeping them accessible to the AI on demand. These two
files mean _different_ things, and Rulesync's `ignore` feature models a single
canonical ignore list per tool with no per-pattern distinction between
"block access" and "exclude from indexing only". Emitting the same patterns to
both files would be incorrect, so `.cursorindexingignore` is intentionally **not
generated** (an intentional non-goal). Author it by hand if you need
indexing-only excludes.

By default, Claude Code's deny list is written to the **shared**
`.claude/settings.json` so that the policy can be committed and reviewed by
the team. This is intentional (see issue #1094), but it means that running
`rulesync gitignore` will not add `.claude/settings.json` to `.gitignore` -
that file may also contain other shared Claude config you actively want to
commit.

If you would rather keep the deny list out of version control, opt into the
**local** mode using the per-feature options object form:

```jsonc
// rulesync.jsonc
{
  "targets": ["claudecode"],
  "features": {
    "claudecode": {
      "ignore": { "fileMode": "local" },
    },
  },
}
```

| `fileMode`           | Output file                   | Tracked by git by default                             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `"shared"` (default) | `.claude/settings.json`       | Yes - meant to be committed and shared with the team. |
| `"local"`            | `.claude/settings.local.json` | No - `rulesync gitignore` already excludes this file. |

## `.rulesync/permissions.json`

Permissions define which tool actions are allowed, require confirmation, or are denied. The canonical format uses **lowercase tool category names** and **glob patterns** mapped to permission actions.

**Permission actions:**

- `allow` -- Automatically permitted without user confirmation
- `ask` -- Requires user confirmation before execution
- `deny` -- Blocked from execution

**Supported tool categories:** `bash`, `read`, `edit`, `write`, `webfetch`, `websearch`, `grep`, `glob`, `notebookedit`, `agent`, and MCP-specific tool names (e.g., `mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_navigate`)

Example:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://github.com/dyoshikawa/rulesync/releases/latest/download/permissions-schema.json",
  "permission": {
    "bash": {
      "git *": "allow",
      "npm run *": "allow",
      "rm -rf *": "deny",
      "*": "ask"
    },
    "edit": {
      "src/**": "allow"
    },
    "read": {
      ".env": "deny"
    }
  }
}
```

#### JSON Schema Support

Rulesync provides a JSON Schema for editor validation and autocompletion. Add the `$schema` property to your `.rulesync/permissions.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://github.com/dyoshikawa/rulesync/releases/latest/download/permissions-schema.json",
  "permission": {}
}
```

For Claude Code, this generates `permissions.allow`, `permissions.ask`, and `permissions.deny` arrays in `.claude/settings.json` (project mode) or `~/.claude/settings.json` (global mode) using PascalCase tool names (e.g., `Bash(git *)`, `Edit(src/**)`, `Read(.env)`).

> **Claude Code-only override (`claudecode` key):** Claude Code's `permissions` object also carries non-list fields with no canonical permission category - notably `defaultMode` (the session-start permission mode: `default` | `acceptEdits` | `plan` | `bypassPermissions`) and `additionalDirectories` (extra working directories). Add a tool-scoped `claudecode` override key alongside the shared block to author them: the fields under `claudecode.permissions` are merged into the settings `permissions` object and emitted **only** for Claude Code, while the shared `permission` block continues to drive the managed `allow`/`ask`/`deny` arrays. The block is a verbatim passthrough (so other/future `permissions` fields such as the org locks `disableBypassPermissionsMode`/`disableAutoMode` can be set too), but any `allow`/`ask`/`deny` placed inside it is ignored - rulesync owns those arrays. On import, the non-list `permissions` fields round-trip back into the `claudecode` override. Note that these fields are merged **additively** into the existing `settings.json` (so hand-added settings survive): removing a field from the `claudecode` override does not delete a value already written to `settings.json` - clear it there by hand.
>
> ```json
> {
>   "permission": { "bash": { "git *": "allow" } },
>   "claudecode": {
>     "permissions": {
>       "defaultMode": "acceptEdits",
>       "additionalDirectories": ["../shared"]
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```

For OpenCode, this generates the `permission` object in `opencode.json` / `opencode.jsonc` (project mode) or `.config/opencode/opencode.json` / `.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc` (global mode), preserving other existing OpenCode config fields.

> **OpenCode-only override (`opencode` key):** OpenCode exposes permission categories that other tools do not understand (e.g. `external_directory`). Placing these in the shared `permission` block would push meaningless entries into Claude Code, Codex, etc. To scope them to OpenCode, add a tool-scoped `opencode` override key alongside the shared block - mirroring the tool-scoped override keys used by [hooks](#rulesynchooksjson) (`opencode.hooks`) and rules frontmatter. Categories under `opencode.permission` are merged on top of the shared block **per category** (the override wins) and are emitted **only** into `opencode.json` / `opencode.jsonc`; every other tool ignores them. Each value may be a bare action string (`"deny"`) or a pattern map (`{ "*": "ask" }`), matching OpenCode's own permission syntax.
>
> ```jsonc
> {
>   "permission": {
>     "bash": { "git *": "allow", "*": "ask" },
>   },
>   // Emitted only into opencode.json's `permission`; never leaks to other tools.
>   "opencode": {
>     "permission": {
>       "external_directory": "deny",
>     },
>   },
> }
> ```
>
> On **import**, any OpenCode category that is not a shared canonical rulesync category (`bash`, `read`, `edit`, `write`, `webfetch`, `websearch`, `grep`, `glob`, `notebookedit`, `agent`, the all-tools key `*`, or an `mcp__*` tool name) is routed into the `opencode` override rather than the shared block, so a subsequent `rulesync generate` does not leak it into other tools.
>
> You may also override a **shared** category for OpenCode specifically (e.g. put `webfetch` under `opencode.permission` to give OpenCode a different value than the shared block sends to other tools). On generate this works as expected, but note the override is not round-trip stable for shared categories: re-importing the generated `opencode.json` classifies a shared category back into the shared block, so prefer expressing OpenCode-only categories here and keeping cross-tool categories in the shared block.

For Hermes Agent, permissions are written into the shared `~/.hermes/config.yaml` (global only). Canonical rules map onto the structures Hermes's runtime actually enforces:

- `allow` patterns (all categories) → `command_allowlist`.
- `bash` `deny` patterns → `approvals.deny` - Hermes's hard denylist, evaluated **before** `--yolo` / `approvals.mode: off`.
- `webfetch` `deny` patterns → `security.website_blocklist.domains`.
- Every `ask` rule, and `deny` rules in categories other than `bash`/`webfetch`, have no native per-pattern Hermes primitive; they survive only for round-trip (Rulesync also stores the full canonical config under a private `permissions.rulesync` key so `.rulesync/permissions.json` reconstructs losslessly).

> **Hermes-only override (`hermes` key):** Hermes exposes approval/security controls with no canonical permission category - e.g. `approvals` (`mode`, `cron_mode`, `mcp_reload_confirm`, ...), `security` (`allow_private_urls`, ...), `skills.write_approval`, `memory.write_approval`. Add a tool-scoped `hermes` override key alongside the shared block to author them; its contents are **deep-merged** into `config.yaml` (so an `approvals.mode` here coexists with the `approvals.deny` derived from canonical deny rules) and are emitted **only** for Hermes. The block is a verbatim passthrough, so any current or future Hermes config key can be set without Rulesync modeling each one. Note that the deep merge replaces **arrays** wholesale, so setting `hermes.approvals.deny` or `hermes.security.website_blocklist.domains` overrides (does not append to) the list derived from the shared `permission` block - use it only when you intend to replace the canonical-derived deny list for Hermes. The top-level `permissions` key is reserved by Rulesync for the round-trip blob, so a `permissions` key inside the `hermes` override is ignored.
>
> ```json
> {
>   "permission": { "bash": { "rm -rf *": "deny" } },
>   "hermes": {
>     "approvals": { "mode": "smart" },
>     "security": { "allow_private_urls": false }
>   }
> }
> ```

For Codex CLI, this generates a `rulesync` named profile in `.codex/config.toml` under `[permissions.rulesync]` and sets `default_permissions = "rulesync"` (project/global depending on mode). It also generates `.codex/rules/rulesync.rules` from `permission.bash` entries using `prefix_rule(...)`. Current Rulesync-to-Codex mapping supports `bash`, `read`, `edit`/`write`, and `webfetch` categories:

- `bash`: generates one `prefix_rule(...)` per command pattern in `.codex/rules/rulesync.rules` (`allow` → `allow`, `ask` → `prompt`, `deny` → `forbidden`)
- `read`: `allow` → `read`, `ask`/`deny` → `deny` in `permissions.<profile>.filesystem`
- `edit` / `write`: `allow` → `write`, `ask`/`deny` → `deny` in `permissions.<profile>.filesystem`
- `webfetch`: `allow`/`deny` map to `permissions.<profile>.network.domains` (Codex does not support `ask` for domain rules); `network.enabled = true` is emitted only when at least one `allow` rule is present. Deny-only domain sets are emitted without `enabled`, which Codex treats as restricted (its default) while the deny entries still round-trip back into Rulesync rules. Codex rejects the global wildcard `*` in denied domains at config load time, so `webfetch: { "*": "deny" }` is skipped with a warning (unlisted domains are denied by Codex's allowlist-first policy anyway); `webfetch: { "*": "allow" }` is emitted as a regular `"*" = "allow"` domain entry, which Codex accepts for denylist-only setups ([openai/codex#15549](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/15549)). On import, `deny` entries are always taken, while `allow` entries are imported only when `enabled = true` is explicit - Codex treats a missing `enabled` as restricted, so importing an allow entry from a disabled profile would activate a grant Codex never had. A Codex profile with `network.enabled = true` but no `domains` is imported as `webfetch: { "*": "allow" }`, which reflects Codex's default semantics where `enabled = true` grants sandbox-wide network access (under Codex's experimental `network_proxy` feature, `enabled = true` without an allowlist blocks requests instead, and the regenerated `"*" = "allow"` entry is the closest equivalent).

Relative filesystem globs such as `src/**` or `**/*.tf` are emitted under `permissions.<profile>.filesystem.":workspace_roots"` instead of the top-level filesystem table, because Codex expects top-level filesystem keys to be absolute paths, `~/...`, or named roots. Rulesync also sets `glob_scan_max_depth = 8` when generated workspace-root rules contain unbounded `**` patterns.

Codex's built-in `:workspace` baseline grants read access to the whole filesystem and write access to the entire workspace root plus `/tmp` and `$TMPDIR` (with carve-outs protecting `.git`, `.codex`, and `.agents`), and Codex filesystem entries grant access on their own without `extends`. Rulesync therefore emits `extends = ":workspace"` only when a workspace-wide write rule is present (`edit`/`write` with pattern `.`, `./`, `**`, or `./**`); narrowly scoped or workspace-external write rules are expressed purely as `filesystem` entries so the profile never grants more than what the rules ask for. Conversely, a Codex profile that grants write solely via `extends = ":workspace"` is imported as `edit: { ".": "allow" }`, so regeneration converges back to the same `extends` shape instead of dropping the grant.

Rulesync always emits `":minimal" = "read"` in the generated filesystem table. This enables `include_platform_defaults()` ([FileSystemSpecialPath::Minimal](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/13434)), which provides the platform/runtime read access needed for basic sandboxed command execution on macOS, Linux, and Windows. `:minimal` is the only special path treated as a non-user-managed fixed baseline: it is always emitted and is never imported into Rulesync's own permission model. The other special paths `:root`, `:tmpdir`, and `:slash_tmp` are user-managed access rules that are imported into the Rulesync model and re-emitted from it like any ordinary filesystem entry (`:root = "deny"` becomes a read/edit deny, `:tmpdir = "write"` becomes an edit allow, and so on). Because they round-trip through `.rulesync/permissions.json` rather than relying on an existing `.codex/config.toml`, a restrictive value such as `:root = "deny"` survives a fresh-clone `rulesync generate` with no pre-existing Codex config.

`network.mode`, `network.unix_sockets`, and `description` have no equivalent in Rulesync's canonical permissions model and are not generated. If an existing `.codex/config.toml` already contains these fields on the `rulesync` profile, Rulesync preserves them on regeneration. Note that `filesystem`, `network.enabled`, `network.domains`, and `extends` are always managed by Rulesync (derived from `edit`/`write`/`webfetch` rules), so hand-authored values in those fields will be replaced on regeneration.

> **Codex CLI-only override (`codexcli` key):** Codex CLI's permission surface is richer than the canonical allow/ask/deny model - its approval workflow, classic sandbox system, and per-app tool gating have no canonical category. Add a tool-scoped `codexcli` override to author them: its fields are written verbatim as **top-level `.codex/config.toml` keys** (the override wins per key; existing sibling keys the user set directly are preserved, and table values are shallow-merged) while the shared `permission` block keeps driving the managed `[permissions.rulesync]` profile and `default_permissions`. Supported keys: `approval_policy` (`untrusted` | `on-request` | `never`, or a `{ granular = { … } }` table kept verbatim), `sandbox_mode` (`read-only` | `workspace-write` | `danger-full-access`) with the sibling `sandbox_workspace_write` table (`network_access`, `writable_roots`, …), `apps` (per-app tool gating - `apps.<id>.tools.<tool>.approval_mode` / `.enabled`, `apps.<id>.default_tools_approval_mode`), and `approvals_reviewer`. On import, these top-level keys round-trip back into the `codexcli` override. It is a `looseObject`, so future top-level Codex config keys can be authored here (merged verbatim on generate; only the listed keys are re-extracted on import). Example: `{ "permission": { … }, "codexcli": { "approval_policy": "on-request", "sandbox_mode": "workspace-write", "sandbox_workspace_write": { "network_access": true } } }`. **Out of scope:** `mcp_servers.*` per-MCP gating is **not** authorable here - it is owned by the MCP feature (`codexcli-mcp.ts` writes the `mcp_servers` tables in the same `config.toml`), and `permissions` / `default_permissions` are owned by the canonical model; any such key placed in the override is skipped with a warning. See the [Codex configuration reference](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference) and [permissions docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/permissions).

For Kiro, this generates tool permission settings in `.rulesync/agents/default.json` (project mode):

- `bash` maps to `toolsSettings.shell.allowedCommands` / `toolsSettings.shell.deniedCommands`
- `read` maps to `toolsSettings.read.allowedPaths` / `toolsSettings.read.deniedPaths`
- `edit` / `write` map to `toolsSettings.write.allowedPaths` / `toolsSettings.write.deniedPaths`
- `grep` maps to `toolsSettings.grep.allowedPaths` / `toolsSettings.grep.deniedPaths`
- `glob` maps to `toolsSettings.glob.allowedPaths` / `toolsSettings.glob.deniedPaths` (both emitted only when a rule is present, so existing configs do not gain empty tables)
- `webfetch` / `websearch` with pattern `*` map to `allowedTools` entries (`web_fetch` / `web_search`)
- `ask` rules are skipped with a warning (Kiro config does not support explicit ask entries)

> **Kiro-only override (`kiro` key):** Kiro's agent config exposes per-tool `toolsSettings` knobs with no canonical allow/ask/deny category. Author them through a tool-scoped `kiro` override under `toolsSettings`: the shell auto-trust flags `shell.autoAllowReadonly` / `shell.denyByDefault`, the `aws` built-in tool's `allowedServices` / `deniedServices` (+ `autoAllowReadonly`), and the `web_fetch` domain trust arrays `trusted` / `blocked` (regex host patterns; Kiro documents these for `web_fetch` only - `web_search` has no domain-trust surface). Example: `{ "permission": { … }, "kiro": { "toolsSettings": { "shell": { "autoAllowReadonly": true }, "aws": { "allowedServices": ["s3"], "deniedServices": ["eks"] }, "web_fetch": { "trusted": [".*github\\.com.*"] } } } }`. The override is **deep-merged per `toolsSettings` key** (the override wins at the leaf) so authoring `shell.autoAllowReadonly` keeps the canonical-generated `shell.allowedCommands`; the shared `permission` block keeps driving `shell.{allowed,denied}Commands`, `read`/`write`/`grep`/`glob` paths, and the `web_fetch`/`web_search` `allowedTools` toggles. Existing non-canonical `shell` flags are preserved across regenerate even without an override. On **import**, these Kiro-specific surfaces are lifted into the `kiro` override so they round-trip. It is a `looseObject` at every level, so future Kiro `toolsSettings` fields pass through verbatim. **Out of scope:** Kiro's MCP `autoApprove` / `disabledTools` lists are **not** modeled here - they live in a separate file (`.rulesync/settings/mcp.json`, under `mcpServers.<name>`), not the agent config this translator writes, and reconciling them with the canonical `mcp__*` model is a distinct design question. See the [Kiro built-in tools](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/reference/built-in-tools/) and [configuration reference](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/custom-agents/configuration-reference/) docs.

For Cursor CLI, this generates `permissions` entries in `.cursor/cli.json` (project mode) or `~/.cursor/cli-config.json` (global mode). Cursor CLI only supports `allow` and `deny` decisions, so `ask` rules are skipped with a warning. Tool categories are mapped to PascalCase Cursor tool names (`bash` → `Shell`, `read` → `Read`, `edit`/`write` → `Write`, `webfetch` → `WebFetch`, `mcp__*` → `Mcp`). Existing Cursor-specific entries that Rulesync does not manage (for example, MCP entries with extra fields) are preserved on round-trip.

> **Cursor-only override (`cursor` key):** Cursor's `cli.json` carries scalar autonomy settings with no canonical permission category - `approvalMode` (`allowlist` | `auto-review` | `unrestricted`) and a `sandbox` object (`mode`/`networkAccess`). Add a tool-scoped `cursor` override to author them: its fields are merged into the top level of `cli.json` while the shared `permission` block keeps driving the `permissions.allow`/`permissions.deny` arrays (the override cannot clobber that managed block). On import, `approvalMode` and `sandbox` round-trip back into the `cursor` override. It is a `looseObject`, so `sandbox`'s (currently undocumented) value set passes through verbatim and extra `cli.json` keys can be authored here (they are merged verbatim on generate); note that only `approvalMode` and `sandbox` are re-extracted on import.

> {
>   "permission": { "bash": { "git *": "allow" } },

> The separate Cursor **IDE** `permissions.json` (`mcpAllowlist`, `terminalAllowlist`, `autoRun.*`) is a different file and is not targeted by this translator.

For Kilo Code, this generates the `permission` object in `kilo.jsonc` (project mode) or `~/.config/kilo/kilo.jsonc` (global mode). The shape is identical to OpenCode's (Kilo is an OpenCode fork), so categories like `bash`, `read`, `edit`, `write`, `webfetch`, and `mcp` accept either a string catch-all (`"allow" | "ask" | "deny"`) or a `{ <pattern>: <action> }` map. Other top-level keys in `kilo.jsonc` are preserved on round-trip. **The `permission` object is merged per top-level tool key**: for each tool key present in the rulesync output, that key is replaced entirely from rulesync (rulesync owns its managed keys; manual edits inside a managed key will be overwritten on the next generation). Tool keys that exist in the existing `kilo.jsonc` but are NOT in the rulesync output are preserved verbatim so user-added Kilo-only categories survive regeneration. When a regenerate replaces a key whose existing value contained `deny` patterns that disappear from the new rulesync output, an aggregated `logger.warn` enumerates the dropped patterns (matching the project convention used by every other permissions translator). Edits to other top-level keys (e.g. `model`) are preserved. **Malformed `kilo.jsonc` aborts the run**: the `jsonc-parser` library would otherwise silently coerce a syntax error to `{}` and overwrite the corrupted file with an empty `permission`, dropping the user's existing `deny` rules. Rulesync now surfaces parse errors so the run aborts before any destructive write - matching the strict `JSON.parse` behavior used by every other permissions translator.

> **Kilo-only override (`kilo` key):** Kilo's `permission` object carries tool-specific keys with no canonical permission category - OpenCode-inherited ones (`external_directory`, `doom_loop`, `lsp`, `question`, `todowrite`, `skill`, `task`, `list`) and Kilo-unique ones (`agent_manager`, `notebook_read`, `notebook_edit`, `notebook_execute`, `repo_clone`, `repo_overview`). Add a tool-scoped `kilo` override key alongside the shared block (mirroring the `opencode` override) to author these; entries under `kilo.permission` are merged on top of the shared block **per key** (the override wins) and are emitted **only** into `kilo.jsonc`. Each value may be a bare action string or a pattern map. On **import**, any Kilo key that is not a shared canonical category (`bash`, `read`, `edit`, `webfetch`, `websearch`, `grep`, `glob`, the all-tools key `*`, or an `mcp__*` tool name) is routed into the `kilo` override rather than the shared block, so a subsequent `rulesync generate` does not leak it into other tools.
>
> **Name-mismatch traps.** Canonical category names do not always match Kilo's key names: Kilo folds **`write` into `edit`** (there is no `write` key), uses **`notebook_edit`** (not the canonical `notebookedit`) and **`task`/`agent_manager`** (not `agent`), and has **no `mcp` key** (MCP is addressed via `mcp__*` tool-name keys). Rulesync passes key names through verbatim, so author Kilo keys using Kilo's own names (e.g. put a `notebook_edit` rule under `kilo.permission`, not the canonical `notebookedit`). Kilo also treats a `null` action as a delete sentinel; Rulesync does not model `null` and only round-trips `allow`/`ask`/`deny`.

For AugmentCode CLI, this generates `toolPermissions` entries in `.augment/settings.json` (project mode) or `~/.augment/settings.json` (global mode). Each entry has `toolName`, an optional `shellInputRegex` (only for shell commands), and `permission.type` ∈ `"allow" | "deny" | "ask-user"`. Tool category mapping: `bash` → `launch-process`, `read` → `view`, `edit` → `str-replace-editor`, `write` → `save-file`, `webfetch` → `web-fetch`, `websearch` → `web-search`. Action mapping: rulesync `ask` → AugmentCode `ask-user`. For `bash` patterns other than `*`, the glob pattern is converted to a regex and emitted as `shellInputRegex`. The glob → regex conversion maps `*` to `.*`, `?` to `.`, escapes `\^$.|+(){}[]`, and anchors at both ends; characters outside that set (notably `-`, `/`, `:`, `,`) are emitted verbatim, so Augment will match them literally. Generated entries are sorted **deny first, ask second, allow last**, with more specific patterns (those carrying `shellInputRegex`) before catch-alls - this is required because Augment's `toolPermissions` is evaluated **first-match-wins**. Existing `toolPermissions` entries whose `toolName` is NOT in the rulesync-managed set are preserved on round-trip; existing **`deny` entries for ANY managed `toolName`** (`launch-process`, `view`, `str-replace-editor`, `save-file`, `web-fetch`, `web-search`) are also preserved (fail-closed) so a user-added deny rule on any managed tool cannot be silently downgraded by regeneration. Existing managed-tool `allow` / `ask-user` entries are still replaced (rulesync owns the permissive surface for managed namespaces). **Non-bash categories do not have a documented per-input matcher in AugmentCode**, so Rulesync emits at most one catch-all entry per tool: if the rulesync category contains any `deny` rule, Rulesync emits a single `deny` entry for the entire tool (fail-closed) and warns; otherwise only `*`-pattern allow/ask rules are emitted and any non-`*` allow/ask patterns are dropped with a warning. Importing AugmentCode entries back into rulesync recovers `bash` patterns from `shellInputRegex` but the other categories always import as the catch-all `*` pattern. **The import direction also applies fail-closed precedence** when multiple existing entries collapse to the same `(canonical, "*")` key (e.g. `[{view: deny}, {view: allow}]`): the most restrictive action wins regardless of iteration order (precedence: `deny` > `ask` > `allow`), so a user-added deny in the source file is never silently dropped by import order. The `launch-process` (bash) path is unchanged because each entry has its own `shellInputRegex`-derived pattern with no `"*"` collapse. On **import** (project scope), Rulesync also reads the layered overrides file `<workspace>/.augment/settings.local.json` - a gitignored, machine-specific file that Auggie merges on top of `settings.json` - and combines it over the base settings before converting to the canonical model, following Auggie's documented layering (simple values take the local override, `mcpServers`/`plugins` replace wholesale, and other objects/lists - including `toolPermissions`, which Auggie concatenates local-first under first-match - are combined across tiers), so personal permission overrides are picked up without dropping a committed base `deny`. This overlay is **import-only and project-only**: Rulesync never writes `settings.local.json` (it stays a user-owned, gitignored file), and AugmentCode documents no global `~/.augment/settings.local.json`, so the overlay is skipped in global mode. An unknown top-level key such as `recommendedMarketplaces` (added in Auggie CLI 0.20.0) is preserved verbatim through the generate round-trip via the `{...settings}` merge.

> **AugmentCode-only override (`augmentcode` key):** AugmentCode's `toolPermissions[]` supports "custom policy" entries the canonical allow/ask/deny model cannot express - `permission.type` of `webhook-policy` / `script-policy` (delegating the decision to a `webhookUrl` / `script`) and an `eventType` of `tool-response` (a post-execution check rather than the default pre-execution `tool-call`). Author these through a tool-scoped `augmentcode` override with a `toolPermissions` array of verbatim entries: `{ "permission": { … }, "augmentcode": { "toolPermissions": [ { "toolName": "github-api", "permission": { "type": "webhook-policy", "webhookUrl": "https://api.example.com/validate" } }, { "toolName": "view", "eventType": "tool-response", "permission": { "type": "allow" } } ] } }`. Authored entries are **prepended** - ahead of the canonical-generated basic rules - so a webhook/script gate or tool-response check is never shadowed by a regenerated allow/deny/ask entry under first-match-wins. When the override authors `toolPermissions` it becomes the source of truth for the special entries (the existing file's specials are no longer separately preserved, avoiding a double-emit); without an override, any special entries already present in `settings.json` are preserved verbatim as before. On **import**, special entries are lifted verbatim into the `augmentcode` override (rather than being skipped with a warning) so they round-trip and become user-authorable; basic entries continue to drive the shared `permission` block. Kept a loose passthrough so `shellInputRegex`, `eventType`, `webhookUrl`, `script`, and any future policy field survive untouched. Both project and global scope are supported.

For Factory Droid, this generates `commandAllowlist` / `commandDenylist` arrays in `.factory/settings.json` (project mode) or `~/.factory/settings.json` (global mode). Factory Droid only gates **shell commands** through these two lists, so only the rulesync `bash` category is translated: `allow` patterns become `commandAllowlist` entries (run without confirmation) and `deny` patterns become `commandDenylist` entries (always require confirmation; the denylist wins when a command is in both). Factory Droid has **no separate `ask` list** - any command not in the allowlist already prompts - so rulesync `ask` rules are dropped. Categories other than `bash` cannot be represented in the command allow/deny model and are skipped, with a `logger.warn` when a skipped category carries a `deny` rule (to surface the gap). rulesync owns the `commandAllowlist` / `commandDenylist` keys (they are replaced from the rulesync output), while every other key in `settings.json` (e.g. `hooks`) is preserved verbatim on round-trip - except the Factory-specific security keys covered by the `factorydroid` override below, which are lifted into that override on import. Importing reads the two lists back into the `bash` category.

> **Factory Droid-only override (`factorydroid` key):** Factory Droid has security controls that do not fit the per-command `allow`/`ask`/`deny` model - the hard-block `commandBlocklist` tier (commands that can **never** run, not even under full autonomy - distinct from an approvable `deny`), plus `networkPolicy` (`allowedIps`), `sandbox` (`enabled`/`mode`/`filesystem`/`network`), `mcpPolicy`, `enableDroidShield`, and autonomy settings (`sessionDefaultSettings`, `maxAutonomyLevel`, `interactionMode`). Add a tool-scoped `factorydroid` override to author them: its keys are merged into `settings.json` (the override wins) while the shared `permission` block keeps driving `commandAllowlist`/`commandDenylist`. On **import**, these keys are lifted into the `factorydroid` override - so `commandBlocklist` now round-trips faithfully (its never-runs guarantee is preserved) rather than being collapsed onto an approvable `deny`.

For Cline CLI, this generates `.cline/command-permissions.json` (project mode only). Cline reads this file via the `CLINE_COMMAND_PERMISSIONS` environment variable; you can wire it up with `export CLINE_COMMAND_PERMISSIONS=$(cat .cline/command-permissions.json)`. The schema is `{ "allow": [...], "deny": [...], "allowRedirects": false }`. Cline only supports shell commands and only `allow`/`deny`. Non-`bash` categories are dropped and rulesync `ask` rules for `bash` are **translated to `deny`** (fail-closed safety, since Cline lacks `ask` semantics); both translation notices are surfaced via a single aggregated `logger.warn` per generation (matching the project convention used by every other permissions translator) so the translation stays visible without tripping CI gates that treat error lines as failures. **The `allow` array is wholesale-replaced by rulesync** - user-added entries inside `allow` are not preserved on regenerate. **The `deny` array is additive** - user-added denies in the existing file are preserved on every generation alongside the rulesync-derived denies (fail-closed standard). The `allowRedirects` field (a single global boolean gating shell redirection operators `>`/`>>`/`<`) can be authored from rulesync via a tool-scoped **`cline` override** - add `"cline": { "allowRedirects": true }` alongside the shared `permission` block. Precedence: the `cline` override wins, otherwise the existing file value is preserved, otherwise it defaults to `false`. On import, a `true` value round-trips back into the `cline` override (the default `false` emits no override). Cline does not have a stable per-user file location for command permissions, so global mode is not supported. If a pattern ends up in **both** `allow` and `deny` (defensive check; not reachable from a single rulesync config), Rulesync emits a warning because Cline does not document a deterministic deny-priority.

For Zed, this generates the `agent.tool_permissions` object in `.zed/settings.json` (project mode) or `~/.config/zed/settings.json` (global mode). Each canonical category becomes a key under `agent.tool_permissions.tools.<tool>` (tool-name mapping: `bash` → `terminal`, `read` → `read_file`, `edit` → `edit_file`, `webfetch` → `fetch`, `websearch` → `web_search`; unknown categories, including `mcp:<server>:<tool>` keys, pass through unchanged). Within a category, the catch-all `*` pattern sets the per-tool `default`, while specific patterns become `always_allow` / `always_deny` / `always_confirm` entries of the form `{ "pattern": <regex>, "case_sensitive": false }`. Action mapping: rulesync `ask` ⇄ Zed `confirm` (`allow`/`deny` are shared). Because Zed matches with regular expressions, patterns are emitted verbatim - author canonical patterns as regexes when targeting Zed. The settings file is shared with the MCP (`context_servers`) and ignore (`private_files`) features, so writes merge non-destructively: unrelated settings, the top-level `agent.tool_permissions.default`, and any `tools.<tool>` entries NOT managed by rulesync are preserved on round-trip. The canonical model has no slot for per-pattern case sensitivity, so rulesync always emits `case_sensitive: false`; a hand-authored `case_sensitive: true` on a rulesync-managed tool is overwritten on the next generate.

For Qwen Code, this generates `permissions.allow`, `permissions.ask`, and `permissions.deny` arrays in `.qwen/settings.json` (project mode) or `~/.qwen/settings.json` (global mode). The format mirrors Claude Code's: entries are `Bash(<pattern>)`, `Read(<pattern>)`, `Edit(<pattern>)`, `Write(<pattern>)`, `WebFetch(<pattern>)`, `WebSearch(<pattern>)`, `Grep(<pattern>)`, `Glob(<pattern>)`, `Agent(<pattern>)`, etc. Other top-level keys in `settings.json` are preserved on round-trip. Patterns may contain nested parentheses (e.g. `Bash(echo (a))`); Rulesync uses the **last** `)` as the closing delimiter when parsing, so inner parens round-trip. Malformed entries (missing closing paren, trailing characters) emit a warning; for **`deny`** they fall back to the catch-all pattern `*` (fail-closed: broadening a deny is the safer direction), but for **`allow` / `ask`** they are **dropped** rather than broadened - silently turning a narrow user rule into `*` would be a fail-open round-trip. Generation does not create the `.qwen/` directory until `writeAiFiles` runs, so dry-run is side-effect-free.

> **Qwen-only override (`qwencode` key):** Qwen's `settings.json` exposes autonomy/sandbox controls with no canonical permission category - under `tools` (`approvalMode` = `plan`/`default`/`auto-edit`/`auto`/`yolo`, `autoAccept`, `sandbox`, `sandboxImage`, `disabled`) and `security` (`folderTrust`). Add a tool-scoped `qwencode` override to author them: `qwencode.tools` and `qwencode.security` are shallow-merged into the matching `settings.json` group at the **top level of that group** (an unrelated sibling key such as `tools.core` is preserved, an override key wins, and a nested object the override supplies such as `security.folderTrust` replaces the existing one wholesale rather than being deep-merged), while the shared `permission` block keeps driving the `permissions.allow`/`ask`/`deny` arrays. On import, the documented autonomy keys (`tools.{approvalMode,autoAccept,sandbox,sandboxImage,disabled}` and `security.folderTrust`) round-trip back into the override; other `tools`/`security` keys are left in `settings.json` and not extracted.

> **Alias overlap:** Qwen's `Read` is a meta-tool that also covers grep/glob/list, so canonical `grep`/`glob` rules are emitted as their own `Grep(...)`/`Glob(...)` entries but overlap Qwen's `Read` category at runtime; and Qwen folds web search into `web_fetch`, so a canonical `websearch` rule (`WebSearch(...)`) may not correspond to a distinct Qwen tool. `tools.disabled` is a hard whole-tool disable (stronger than `deny`) and is only authorable via the override, not the canonical `deny`.

For Warp, this generates the `agent_mode_command_execution_allowlist` / `agent_mode_command_execution_denylist` regex arrays under the `[agents.profiles]` table of Warp's global user `settings.toml` (**global mode only** - Warp has no project-scoped permissions file). The settings file path differs per platform: macOS `~/.warp/settings.toml`, Linux `~/.config/warp-terminal/settings.toml`, Windows `%LOCALAPPDATA%\warp\Warp\config\settings.toml`. Only the `bash` category maps (`allow` → allowlist, `deny` → denylist); Warp matches commands with **regular expressions**, so patterns are emitted verbatim - author canonical `bash` patterns as regexes when targeting Warp (mirrors Zed). Warp has no per-command `ask` list, so `ask` rules are dropped, and non-`bash` categories are skipped (with a warning when they carry `deny` rules). On import, a pattern present in both lists resolves to `deny` (Warp's denylist wins). The `[agents.profiles]` block is merged into the existing `settings.toml`, preserving other Warp settings, and the file is never deleted. **rulesync owns the two command lists** (it is the source of truth): the `allowlist`/`denylist` are replaced from the rulesync config on each `--global` generate, so a manually curated Warp allowlist/denylist not mirrored in `.rulesync/permissions.json` is overwritten - keep command permissions in rulesync. MCP allow/deny is a separate Warp surface not modeled here. See the [Warp agent profiles & permissions docs](https://docs.warp.dev/agent-platform/capabilities/agent-profiles-permissions/).

> **Warp-only override (`warp` key):** Warp's `[agents.profiles]` table also exposes file-read/read-only autonomy knobs that do not fit the per-command `allow`/`ask`/`deny` model - `agent_mode_coding_permissions` (`always_ask_before_reading` / `always_allow_reading` / `allow_reading_specific_files`), `agent_mode_coding_file_read_allowlist` (an array of paths the agent may read), and `agent_mode_execute_readonly_commands` (a boolean auto-executing read-only commands). Add a tool-scoped `warp` override to author them: its keys are merged into `[agents.profiles]` (the override wins) while the shared `permission` block keeps driving the `agent_mode_command_execution_allowlist`/`_denylist` command arrays. On **import**, these keys are lifted from `settings.toml` into the `warp` override, so they round-trip faithfully instead of being dropped. Example:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "permission": { "bash": { "git .*": "allow" } },
>   "warp": {
>     "agent_mode_coding_permissions": "always_allow_reading",
>     "agent_mode_execute_readonly_commands": true

For the Antigravity IDE, this generates `permissions.allow`, `permissions.ask`, and `permissions.deny` arrays in the committable workspace `.antigravity/settings.json` (**project mode only**). Antigravity 2.0 evaluates these `Deny > Ask > Allow` and uses `action(target)` entries; rulesync maps canonical categories onto the IDE action vocabulary: `read` → `read_file`, `edit`/`write` → `write_file`, `bash` → `command`, `webfetch`/`websearch` → `read_url`, `mcp` → `mcp` (the IDE-only `execute_url` / `unsandboxed` actions have no canonical equivalent and pass through verbatim). Because `edit`/`write` collapse to `write_file` and `webfetch`/`websearch` collapse to `read_url`, importing normalizes back to `write` / `webfetch` (a documented, lossy mapping). The `settings.json` file holds other workspace settings, so the `permissions` block is merged in place - entries for unmanaged actions are preserved - and the file is never deleted. The User-scope settings file is a platform-dependent VS-Code-style path outside rulesync's home-relative global model, so **global mode is not supported**; the workspace file is intended to be checked into git. See the [Antigravity permissions docs](https://antigravity.google/docs/permissions).

For the Antigravity CLI (`agy`), this generates `permissions.allow`, `permissions.ask`, and `permissions.deny` arrays in the global `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json` (**global mode only**). The CLI shares Antigravity 2.0's Fine-Grained Permissions Engine with the IDE, so the same `action(target)` vocabulary and `Deny > Ask > Allow` precedence apply: `read` → `read_file`, `edit`/`write` → `write_file`, `bash` → `command`, `webfetch`/`websearch` → `read_url`, `mcp` → `mcp` (the engine-only `execute_url` / `unsandboxed` actions pass through verbatim). Because `edit`/`write` collapse to `write_file` and `webfetch`/`websearch` collapse to `read_url`, importing normalizes back to `write` / `webfetch` (a documented, lossy mapping). The `settings.json` holds other CLI settings, so the `permissions` block is merged in place - entries for unmanaged actions are preserved - and the file is never deleted. Two CLI-only autonomy/sandbox knobs outside the allow/ask/deny arrays can be authored (and round-trip) through an optional `antigravity-cli` override block in `.rulesync/permissions.json`: `toolPermission` (the global autonomy preset - `request-review` (default) / `proceed-in-sandbox` / `always-proceed` / `strict`) and `enableTerminalSandbox` (a boolean confining agent-run commands to OS containment). Antigravity applies the allow/deny lists as per-rule exceptions to the preset at runtime, so rulesync authors these keys verbatim as top-level siblings of `permissions` with no precedence modeling. This override is **CLI-only** - the Antigravity IDE exposes the same concepts through a GUI with no documented JSON schema, so it does not apply to `antigravity-ide`. Example: `{ "permission": { … }, "antigravity-cli": { "toolPermission": "strict", "enableTerminalSandbox": true } }`. Verified against the [Antigravity CLI reference](https://antigravity.google/docs/cli/reference) and [sandbox docs](https://antigravity.google/docs/cli/sandbox). See the [Antigravity CLI permissions docs](https://antigravity.google/docs/cli-permissions).

For Rovo Dev CLI, this generates the `toolPermissions` block of the global `~/.rovodev/config.yml` (**global mode only** - Rovo Dev has no project-scoped permissions file, mirroring the Rovodev MCP adapter). Rovo Dev's three levels (`allow`/`ask`/`deny`) are an exact 1:1 with rulesync's canonical actions, so action values pass through verbatim. The `bash` category maps the catch-all `*` pattern to `bash.default` and every other pattern to a `bash.commands[]` entry `{ command: <pattern as regex>, permission }` (Rovo Dev matches commands as regexes, so author `bash` patterns accordingly). The `read` category maps to the inspection tools (`open_files`, `expand_code_chunks`, `expand_folder`, `grep`) and `edit`/`write` to the mutation tools (`find_and_replace_code`, `create_file`, `delete_file`, `move_file`); because these per-tool keys hold a single level (no per-pattern rules), only the catch-all `*` of each category sets the level. Because `edit` and `write` both map onto the same mutation tools, a conflicting catch-all between them cannot be represented; `edit` takes precedence and a warning is logged. Non-catch-all `allow` paths in those categories are surfaced as `allowedExternalPaths` so explicit grants are not dropped; non-`allow` non-catch-all rules cannot be expressed per-path and are skipped with a warning. Categories without a clean Rovo Dev target (e.g. `webfetch`) are skipped with a warning. `config.yml` holds all of Rovo Dev's settings (`agent`, `sessions`, `mcp`, etc.), so the `toolPermissions` block is merged in place - every other top-level key (and any unmanaged keys inside `toolPermissions`) is preserved (values only - YAML comments and formatting in the existing file are not retained on rewrite) - and the file is never deleted. See the [Rovo Dev CLI settings](https://support.atlassian.com/rovo/docs/manage-rovo-dev-cli-settings/) and [tool permissions](https://support.atlassian.com/rovo/docs/use-tools-in-rovo-dev-cli/) docs.

For Goose, this generates the `user` block of the global `~/.config/goose/permission.yaml` (**global mode only** - Goose persists per-tool permission overrides only under the home directory and has no project-scoped permissions file). Goose stores permissions as a YAML map of mode key → `{ always_allow, ask_before, never_allow }`, where each field is a list of tool-name strings; rulesync writes the user-set decisions under the `user` key. Action mapping is a 1:1: `allow` → `always_allow`, `ask` → `ask_before`, `deny` → `never_allow`. Tool-name mapping: `bash` → `developer__shell`, `edit` → `developer__text_editor`; every other category passes through verbatim as the Goose tool name (so namespaced tools like `developer__text_editor` or `developer__image_processor` round-trip). Because Goose permission lists hold **whole tool names** rather than per-command/per-path globs, only a category's catch-all `*` pattern is representable - non-catch-all patterns are skipped with a warning. `write` collapses onto `developer__text_editor` too, so a conflicting `edit`/`write` catch-all cannot be represented; `edit` takes precedence and a warning is logged. The `permission.yaml` file is merged in place: the `user` block is owned by rulesync, while every other top-level key (notably the `smart_approve` LLM-decision cache) is preserved, and the file is never deleted. See the [Goose tool permissions docs](https://goose-docs.ai/docs/guides/managing-tools/tool-permissions/).

For the Grok Build CLI (`grokcli`), this generates Grok's Claude-style `[permission]` rule arrays - `allow` / `deny` / `ask` - in the global `~/.grok/config.toml` (**global mode only** - rulesync syncs the user-level config; Grok also supports a project-scoped `[permission]` file, which is not modeled here). Each canonical `permission.<category>.<pattern>` becomes a Grok entry bucketed into the matching array: `bash`→`Bash`, `read`→`Read`, `edit`→`Edit`, `grep`→`Grep`, `webfetch`→`WebFetch`, and `mcp__<server>__<tool>`→`MCPTool(<server>__<tool>)`; a `*` pattern emits the bare tool name (e.g. `Bash`) and a concrete pattern emits `Tool(pattern)` (e.g. `Bash(git *)`). `write` collapses onto `Edit` (Grok has no separate `Write` tool - a documented lossy mapping), and categories with no Grok tool (`websearch`, `glob`, `notebookedit`, `agent`) are skipped, with a warning when a skipped category carries a `deny` rule. Grok evaluates the arrays with precedence `deny > ask > allow`, which import mirrors (a tool listed in multiple arrays resolves to the strictest action). The coarse `[ui] permission_mode` toggle (`"ask"` / `"always-approve"`) is still written as a backward-compatible fallback for older Grok versions: `always-approve` when the config is pure-`allow`, otherwise `ask` (conservative - never `always-approve` while any `deny`/`ask` rule exists, so it never contradicts the fine-grained arrays). On import, the `[permission]` arrays are parsed back into canonical categories when present; only when no `[permission]` section exists do we fall back to the coarse mode (`always-approve` ⇄ `bash: { "*": "allow" }`, `ask`/unset ⇄ `bash: { "*": "ask" }`). `config.toml` is shared with the MCP feature, so rulesync owns the `[permission]` `allow`/`deny`/`ask` arrays and `[ui] permission_mode` while every other key (e.g. `[mcp_servers]`, verbose `[permission] rules`, `[sandbox]`) is preserved, and the file is never deleted. See the [Grok CLI settings reference](https://docs.x.ai/build/settings/reference) and [modes docs](https://docs.x.ai/build/modes-and-commands).

For Vibe (mistral-vibe), this generates per-tool `[tools.<tool>]` tables in the shared `.vibe/config.toml` (project mode) or `~/.vibe/config.toml` (global mode). Tool-name mapping: `bash` → `bash`, `read` → `read_file`, `edit`/`write` → `write_file`, `webfetch` → `fetch`, `websearch` → `search_web`. Within a category, the catch-all `*` pattern sets the per-tool `permission` (`allow` → `always`, `ask` → `ask`) and also toggles the top-level `enabled_tools` / `disabled_tools` filters; specific patterns become **`allowlist` / `denylist`** entries - these are the keys Vibe's permission engine actually reads (`BaseToolConfig`), so the legacy `allow` / `deny` keys are dropped on generate (still honored as a fallback on import). Vibe has no per-pattern `ask`, so pattern-level `ask` rules are skipped with a warning. The `config.toml` file is shared with the MCP and hooks features, so writes merge non-destructively and the file is never deleted. See [mistral-vibe](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe) (`vibe/core/tools/base.py`).

> **Vibe-only override (`vibe` key):** Vibe's `BaseToolConfig` also carries a `sensitive_patterns` list - patterns that escalate to **ASK even when the base permission is ALWAYS** (allow). The canonical model can only set a pattern to a single `allow`/`ask`/`deny`, so an "allow by default but ask on these patterns" escalation cannot be expressed in the shared block. Add a tool-scoped `vibe` override to author it: `vibe.permission.<category>.sensitive_patterns` carries the list per canonical category (e.g. `bash`, `edit`), while the shared `permission` block still sets the base permission and allow/deny lists. On import, a tool's `sensitive_patterns` round-trips back into the `vibe` override (the base allow stays in the shared block). rulesync owns the list for any category named in the override (a present list is set, an empty one clears it); categories not named keep whatever the existing `config.toml` had.

> ```json
> {
>   "permission": { "bash": { "*": "allow" } },
>   "vibe": {
>     "permission": { "bash": { "sensitive_patterns": ["rm *", "sudo *"] } }
>   }

For Takt, this generates the `default_permission_mode` under `provider_profiles.<provider>` in the shared `.takt/config.yaml` (project mode) or `~/.takt/config.yaml` (global mode). Takt does not have per-tool / per-pattern rules; tool gating is a single coarse mode per provider profile, ordered `readonly` < `edit` < `full` (`readonly` may only read, `edit` may also edit/write files, `full` may also run shell commands). The active provider is named by the top-level `provider:` key (defaulting to `claude`). The mapping is therefore **lossy**: on generate, a single mode is derived with this precedence - (1) any `deny` rule anywhere ⇒ `readonly` (conservative - keep the narrowest mode whenever the user expressed any restriction); (2) else any `edit`/`write` category `allow` rule ⇒ `edit`; (3) else any `bash` category `allow` rule ⇒ `full`; (4) else ⇒ `readonly` (safe default). On import, `full` ⇄ `bash: { "*": "allow" }`, `edit` ⇄ `edit: { "*": "allow" }`, and `readonly` (or an unset/unknown mode) ⇄ `bash: { "*": "deny" }`. `config.yaml` is shared with other Takt settings, so the mode is merged in place - every other provider profile and all other top-level keys are preserved - and the file is never deleted.

Two Takt-specific surfaces with no canonical category can be authored (and round-trip) through an optional `takt` override block in `.rulesync/permissions.json`: `step_permission_overrides` (a per-workflow-step map `<step>` ⇒ `readonly`/`edit`/`full`, written inside the active provider profile and layered by Takt on top of `default_permission_mode`) and `provider_options` (a top-level, per-provider table of sandbox/network knobs orthogonal to the mode, e.g. `codex.network_access`, `claude.sandbox.allow_unsandboxed_commands`, `opencode.allowed_tools`). Example: `{ "permission": { … }, "takt": { "step_permission_overrides": { "ai_review": "readonly" }, "provider_options": { "codex": { "network_access": true } } } }`. Note the workflow-step `required_permission_mode` floor is a field of the **workflow YAML**, not `config.yaml`, so it is intentionally out of scope (Takt's config loader hard-rejects unknown top-level keys). See the [Takt configuration docs](https://github.com/nrslib/takt/blob/main/docs/configuration.md).

For Amp, this writes to the shared `.amp/settings.json` (project mode) or `~/.config/amp/settings.json` (global mode), using **two** permission surfaces. In rulesync's canonical model the category name **is** the Amp tool name. A **whole-tool deny** (pattern `*`) is written to the bare `amp.tools.disable` array (the tool name is pushed verbatim, preserving `builtin:` prefixes and the `*` glob) for backwards compatibility. Every **lossy** case is written to the ordered `amp.permissions` array instead of being dropped: an **argument-specific deny** (pattern `!== "*"`) becomes `{ tool, action: "reject", matches: { cmd: <pattern> } }`, and every `allow` / `ask` rule becomes `{ tool, action, matches?: { cmd } }` (the `matches` object is omitted for the `*` catch-all). Amp evaluates `amp.permissions` **first-match-wins**, so generated entries are ordered deterministically and fail-closed: sorted by tool name, then entries **with** `matches.cmd` (more specific) before catch-alls, then by action priority **`reject` < `ask` < `allow`**, then by `cmd`. `amp.permissions` is Amp's documented **legacy / backwards-compatibility** surface - it remains functional and is the only place to express `allow`/`ask` and argument-specific `reject` rules. **Ownership:** rulesync OWNS and wholesale-replaces the `allow`/`ask`/`reject` entries on every generate, but **preserves any existing `action: "delegate"` entry** (rulesync's canonical model has no `delegate` equivalent); preserved `delegate` entries are placed **after** the rulesync-generated entries (so the regenerated rules take precedence under first-match-wins). On **import**, both keys are read and merged into one canonical config: `amp.tools.disable[tool]` → `{ tool: { "*": "deny" } }`, and each `amp.permissions` entry → `{ tool: { (matches?.cmd ?? "*"): mapped } }` (`reject` → `deny`, `allow` → `allow`, `ask` → `ask`; `delegate` is skipped). When both sources target the same tool+pattern, the **most restrictive action wins** (`deny` > `ask` > `allow`). The settings file is shared with the MCP feature (`amp.mcpServers`), so all other keys are preserved on round-trip and the file is never deleted. Tool names and `cmd` patterns that are prototype-pollution keys (`__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`) are skipped defensively.

Amp shapes with no canonical category are authored (and round-trip) through an optional `amp` override block in `.rulesync/permissions.json`: `permissions` - extra `amp.permissions` entries with non-`cmd` matchers (`path`/`url`/`query`/…), regex/array match values, `context` (`thread`/`subagent`), `delegate` (+`to`), or `reject` (+`message`), appended **after** the canonical-generated entries (so generated allow/ask/reject rules take precedence under first-match-wins, with authored entries as later fallbacks); `mcpPermissions` - Amp's `amp.mcpPermissions` array; `guardedFiles` - `amp.guardedFiles.allowlist` (globs allowed without confirmation); and `dangerouslyAllowAll` - `amp.dangerouslyAllowAll`. When the override authors `permissions` it becomes the source of truth for the extra entries; otherwise any hand-authored `delegate` entry in the existing file is preserved. On import, `amp.permissions` entries that are **not** canonical-expressible (non-`cmd` matcher, `delegate`, `reject`+`message`, `context`) are lifted verbatim into `amp.permissions` of the override rather than dropped. Example: `{ "permission": { … }, "amp": { "dangerouslyAllowAll": false, "guardedFiles": { "allowlist": ["docs/**"] }, "permissions": [{ "tool": "Bash", "action": "delegate", "to": "approve.sh" }] } }`. See the [Amp manual](https://ampcode.com/manual).

For JetBrains Junie CLI, this generates the Action Allowlist `rules` object in `.junie/allowlist.json` (project mode) or `~/.junie/allowlist.json` (global mode). Junie evaluates the allowlist top-to-bottom (first match wins) and groups rules into four buckets, onto which rulesync categories map: `bash` → `executables`, `edit`/`write` → `fileEditing`, `read` → `readOutsideProject`, `mcp` → `mcpTools`. Each rule carries an `action` plus either a literal `prefix` (matches commands that start with it) or a glob `pattern` (`*`, `**`, `?`, `[abc]`, `[!abc]`); rulesync emits `pattern` when the canonical pattern contains a glob metacharacter (`*`, `?`, `[`) and `prefix` otherwise. Junie documents only `allow` and `ask` as valid actions - there is **no `deny`** - so a canonical `deny` is downgraded to the nearest valid action, `ask` (which still withholds auto-approval), with a warning, rather than emitting a `deny` Junie would silently ignore (`allow`/`ask` map 1:1). Categories Junie cannot represent (e.g. `webfetch`, `websearch`) are skipped with a warning when they carry rules. rulesync **owns the `rules` object** (it is replaced from the rulesync output on each generate). Because `edit`/`write` both collapse onto `fileEditing`, importing normalizes back to `edit` (a documented, lossy mapping). The `allowlist.json` file is never deleted. See the [Junie Action Allowlist docs](https://junie.jetbrains.com/docs/action-allowlist-junie-cli.html).

> **Junie-only override (`junie` key):** Junie's `allowlist.json` has two top-level autonomy knobs with no canonical per-glob slot - `allowReadonlyCommands` (a boolean auto-allowing read-only commands) and `defaultBehavior` (the fallback action applied when no rule matches; Junie documents `ask`). Add a tool-scoped `junie` override to author them: its keys are merged onto the top level of `allowlist.json` (the override wins) while the shared `permission` block keeps driving the per-category `rules` groups. On **import**, these keys are lifted from `allowlist.json` into the `junie` override, so they are authorable and portable instead of only round-trip-preserved. Any other unmodeled top-level key is preserved verbatim. Example:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "permission": { "bash": { "git ": "allow" } },
>   "junie": { "allowReadonlyCommands": true, "defaultBehavior": "ask" }
> }
> ```

For Reasonix, this generates `permissions.allow`, `permissions.ask`, and `permissions.deny` arrays in the `[permissions]` table of the shared `reasonix.toml` (project mode) or `~/.reasonix/config.toml` (global mode) - the same TOML file the MCP feature's `[[plugins]]` array-of-tables lives in. The rule syntax mirrors Claude Code's: entries are `Bash(<pattern>)`, `Read(<pattern>)`, `Edit(<pattern>)`, `Write(<pattern>)`, `WebFetch(<pattern>)`, `WebSearch(<pattern>)`, `Grep(<pattern>)`, `Glob(<pattern>)`, `NotebookEdit(<pattern>)`, `Agent(<pattern>)`, etc. (Reasonix's SPEC.md documents these as "Claude Code-style" families; `agent` → `Agent` is the one lower-confidence mapping, since Reasonix's own delegation tool is internally named `task`). `[permissions].mode` (the writer fallback: `ask`/`allow`/`deny`) has no canonical rulesync equivalent and is preserved untouched. The TOML file is shared with the MCP feature, so writes only replace the `permissions` table - every other table (`[[plugins]]`, `[agent]`, `[ui]`, …) is preserved on round-trip, and the file is never deleted. See [SPEC.md §3.7 Permissions](https://github.com/esengine/DeepSeek-Reasonix/blob/main-v2/docs/SPEC.md).

> **Reasonix-only override (`reasonix` key):** Reasonix has security axes orthogonal to per-tool allow/ask/deny with no canonical category - the `[sandbox]` enforcement table (`workspace_root`, `allow_write`, `forbid_read`, `bash` = `enforce`/`off`, `network`) and the plan-mode read-only trust lists under `[agent]` (`plan_mode_allowed_tools`, `plan_mode_read_only_commands`). Add a tool-scoped `reasonix` override to author them: `reasonix.sandbox` and `reasonix.agent` are shallow-merged into the matching `reasonix.toml` table at its top level (override keys win, unrelated sibling keys such as `[agent].model` are preserved), while the shared `permission` block keeps driving `[permissions].allow`/`ask`/`deny`. On import, the whole `[sandbox]` table round-trips (it is a dedicated security surface) and only the plan-mode keys are lifted from `[agent]`.

>
> The `[[plugins]].trusted_read_only_tools` MCP read-only trust list is per-plugin (an array-of-tables shared with the MCP feature) and is not covered by this override.

> **Note: Interaction with ignore feature.** Both the ignore feature and the permissions feature can manage `Read` tool deny entries in `.claude/settings.json`. When both features configure the `Read` tool, the **permissions feature takes precedence** and a warning is emitted. If you only need to restrict file reads based on glob patterns, use the ignore feature (`.rulesync/.aiignore`). Use permissions only when you need fine-grained `allow`/`ask`/`deny` control over the `Read` tool.
