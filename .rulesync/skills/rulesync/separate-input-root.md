# Separate Input Root

The `--input-root <path>` flag lets you point `rulesync generate` at a `.rulesync/` source directory that is different from the current working directory. This decouples where your rule definitions live from where the generated tool configuration files are written.

> **Currently supported on `generate` only.** At present, `--input-root` is wired into the `rulesync generate` command only. Other commands (`import`, `convert`, `gitignore`, `install`, `fetch`, `init`) still read `.rulesync/` from the current working directory. To use the same source directory with those commands, `cd` into the input-root directory first.

## Primary use case: centralized rules across all repos

A common workflow is to keep a single set of AI rules in a shared directory (e.g. `~/.aiglobal`) and apply them to every project without switching directories:

```bash
# In any project directory - rules are read from ~/.aiglobal/.rulesync/
rulesync generate --input-root ~/.aiglobal --targets "*" --features rules
```

Without `--input-root`, you would have to `cd ~/.aiglobal && rulesync generate` and then `cd -` back, and the output files would land in `~/.aiglobal` instead of the current project.

## Step-by-step setup

1. Create and initialize a shared rules directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.aiglobal
   cd ~/.aiglobal
   rulesync init
   ```

2. Edit your shared rules (`~/.aiglobal/.rulesync/rules/overview.md`, etc.) to your preferences.

3. From any project, generate configurations using the shared rules:

   ```bash
   # In your project directory
   rulesync generate --input-root ~/.aiglobal --targets claudecode --features rules
   ```

## Comparison with `--global`

These two flags serve different but complementary purposes:

|              | `--input-root`                                    | `--global`                                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Changes**  | Source location (where `.rulesync/` is read from) | Output location (writes to user-scope config paths, e.g. `~/.claude/`) |
| **Use when** | Your rule definitions live in a non-CWD directory | You want the output to go to the tool's global (user-scope) config     |

They can be combined. For example, to read rules from `~/.aiglobal` and write them to Claude Code's global settings:

```bash
rulesync generate --input-root ~/.aiglobal --global --targets claudecode --features rules
```

> **`--input-root` does not enable `--global`.** When `--input-root` is explicitly provided, Rulesync reads `.rulesync/` from that directory, but output scope still follows the CLI flags: use `--global` for user-scope output, and omit it for project-scope output. A `"global": true` setting in the `rulesync.jsonc` under `--input-root` is **not** applied unless you also pass `--global`, and Rulesync will emit a warning when dropping it so the override is visible.

## Symlinks and trust

Rulesync follows symbolic links during file discovery. A symlink inside `.rulesync/` that points outside the directory will be followed transparently, and the resolved file content will be copied into the generated output. This is intentional: it lets you centralize shared skills or rules in one place and reference them via symlinks from multiple project directories without duplication.

The trust boundary is the directory you point Rulesync at. `--input-root` is `resolve()`-ed to an absolute path before use, but there is no `realpath`-based boundary check on individual symlinks inside it. Only run Rulesync against trees you control. Directory symlink cycles are handled safely - discovery results are deduplicated by real path, so a cycle does not produce duplicated output. See the [File Formats § Symlinks](./file-formats.md#symlinks) note for the behavior that applies across all features.
